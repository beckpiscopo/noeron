System A is connected to a component labeled \"C\" through connections represented by arrows and labels like \"h\\_i\", \"h\\_ij\", and \"h\\_j\". System A also interacts with a series of elements denoted as \"A\\_k\", \"A\\_{k+1}\", and so on, up to \"A\\_n\". These elements are linked by connections labeled \"f\\_{k,k+1}\", \"f\\_{k+1,k+2}\", and so on. Each \"A\" element is associated with a measurement operator \"M\\^A\\_k\", \"M\\^A\\_{k+1}\", etc. System B consists of elements \"q\\_1\", \"q\\_k\", etc., up to \"q\\_N\", each associated with measurement operators \"M\\^B\\_1\", \"M\\^B\\_k\", etc. The interaction between System A and System B is represented by \"H\\_AB\". The figure also mentions \"CCCD\" and \"CCD direction arrows\".\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings or Data Points:**\n\nThe figure is a schematic representation of a theoretical framework. The key data points are the connections and interactions between the different components of the system. The figure suggests that a complex system can be decomposed into interacting subsystems, with System A acting as a computational unit that influences System B. The measurement operators \"M\\^A\\_k\" and \"M\\^B\\_k\" are central to understanding how these systems interact and exchange information. The \"CCCD\" (likely referring to a causal connectivity structure) highlights the flow of information and influence within the system.\n\n3.  **Relation to the Claim:**\n\nThe claim discusses a \"cognitive light cone\" that determines the scale of goals one can pursue and suggests that frameworks like \"active inference\" are universally applicable. The figure relates to this claim by illustrating a system where internal dynamics (P\\_A) compute a function, which is a QRF (likely a quantum random field) deployed by A. This can be interpreted as a simplified model of how a cognitive system (System A) processes information and influences its environment (System B). The \"cognitive light cone\" could be conceptually linked to the constraints imposed by the connections and interactions within the system, limiting the scope of possible actions or goals.

It involves several key components:\n    *   **Environmental State (|E>):** This represents the external information the system is processing.\n    *   **Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs):** These are like \"observers\" or \"measuring devices\" within the system. The figure highlights two specific QRFs: E and Y.\n    *   **QRF E:** This QRF \"reads\" the environmental state |E>.\n    *   **QRF Y:** This QRF \"writes\" the information from E into a memory, represented by Y. Essentially, Y is storing a representation of the observed state.\n    *   **Clock (Gij):** This QRF defines a time coordinate (tA), suggesting that the system's memory is also time-dependent. The clock is associated with a transition from state *i* to state *j*.\n    *   **Blue Oval (B):** This represents the memory or the space where the information is stored.\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings/Data Points:** The figure is a conceptual illustration, not a presentation of experimental data. The key idea is that memory formation can be viewed as a process of transferring information between different quantum reference frames. The system uses QRFs to \"read\" the environment and \"write\" a representation of it into a memory. The inclusion of a time QRF suggests that the system's memory is dynamic and evolves over time.\n\n3.  **Relation to the Claim:** The figure relates to the claim about \"cognitive light cones\" and \"active inference\" by providing a potential mechanism for how a system can represent and act upon its environment. The \"cognitive light cone\" concept refers to the range of goals a system can pursue, which is limited by its ability to perceive and process information. The figure suggests that this ability is based on the system's internal reference frames (QRFs) and how they interact with the environment. Active inference, a framework for understanding behavior, posits that systems actively try to minimize the difference between their internal models of the world and their actual experiences. The figure provides a possible implementation of this, where the system uses QRFs to update its internal model (memory) based on observations of the environment. The time component also suggests that the system can anticipate future states and plan actions accordingly.\n",

        "analysis": "Here's an analysis of the figure, aimed at a general audience:\n\n1.  **Description:** The figure illustrates a single cycle of a memory process, likened to a \"tick\" of an internal clock. This cycle involves reading information, comparing it, and then writing new information. The process is driven by quantum dynamics (represented by P\\_A) and takes place over a small interval of \"external\" time (\u2206t). The figure shows how information is read from (left side) and written to (right side) a memory system (denoted by 'B'). The 'Y' and 'E' likely represent different types of information or states within the memory. The G\\_ij represents the internal clock mechanism.\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings/Data Points:** The figure is a conceptual diagram rather than a presentation of experimental data. The key idea is that memory operations can be viewed as discrete cycles, each requiring a certain amount of time. The figure highlights the role of quantum dynamics in implementing these memory operations and the comparison function. It suggests that internal cognitive processes are linked to the passage of external time.\n\n3.  **Relation to the Claim:** The figure supports the claim about \"cognitive light cones\" by illustrating how a single memory cycle (read-compare-write) defines a fundamental unit of cognitive processing. Each cycle takes a certain amount of time (\u2206t), and a series of these cycles could build up to more complex goals. The \"cognitive light cone\" could be thought of as the set of all possible goals achievable within a certain timeframe, given the speed of these fundamental memory cycles. The active inference framework mentioned in the claim suggests that these cycles are not passive but actively seek to minimize surprise or uncertainty, further shaping the goals that can be pursued.\n",

It shows a system S containing two elements, A and B, each with an associated pointer. The system is then divided into two parts: a \"Reference\" (R) and a \"Pointer\" (P). The Reference R maintains a constant state over time (|R> time invariant), while the Pointer P's state varies over time (|P> time varying). The figure suggests that understanding how the pointer state changes in relation to the stable reference allows us to characterize the system.\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings/Data Points:**\n\nThe key idea is that a system can be understood by identifying a stable reference point within it and observing how other components (the \"pointer\") change relative to that reference.

The data quality threshold is a particularly interesting feature, as it suggests the software is designed to identify and account for potential errors in tracking the planarians' movements.\n\n3.  **Relevance to the Claim:** The related claim is that planarians can retain learned information even after their heads are removed and the brain regenerates. The GUI shown in the figure is relevant because it provides the means to train planarians using light and shock stimuli. The software allows researchers to design experiments to test the planarians' learning abilities and then, presumably, to assess whether that learning is retained after regeneration. The ability to precisely control the training parameters and monitor data quality is crucial for conducting rigorous experiments to investigate this fascinating phenomenon. The GUI allows for the creation of observation-only trials, which could be used to characterize the behavior of planarians after regeneration without further training.\n",

In the \"innate preference\" condition (Panel B), tadpoles don't show a strong preference for either the red or blue side.

Description of the Figure**\n\nThe figure compares the behavior of two types of planarians, *D. japonica* and *S. mediterranea*, in response to light. It uses a combination of bar graphs (A and B), line graphs (C and D), and heatmaps (E and F) to illustrate their movement and preferences. The experiment involved dividing a dish into quadrants and illuminating half with blue light and half with red light. After an hour, the light positions were switched. The graphs show how the planarians spent their time in each area, their average speed, and the percentage of the dish they explored. The heatmaps visually represent the areas where the planarians spent the most time.\n\n**2. Key Scientific Findings**\n\n*   **Light Preference (A, B):** The bar graphs show the percentage of time the planarians spent in each half of the dish (presumably red vs. blue light). The data suggests differences in light preference between the two species, and how this preference changes after the light quadrants are switched. *D. japonica* seems to have a stronger preference or aversion to one of the light conditions compared to *S. mediterranea*.\n*   **Movement (C, D, E, F):** The line graphs show the average speed (C) and the percentage of the dish area visited (D) over time. *D. japonica* initially moves faster and explores more of the dish, but this decreases over time. *S. mediterranea* shows lower activity levels. The heatmaps (E, F) visually confirm these findings, with *S. mediterranea* (F) showing more concentrated movement patterns and a higher percentage of visited area.\n\n**3.

However, it establishes a baseline understanding of the planarians' behavior and responses to stimuli (light, in this case). This type of behavioral assay could be used in experiments to test whether planarians retain learned behaviors (like light preferences) after regeneration. For example, if *D. japonica* were trained to associate a specific light color with a reward, and then regenerated, researchers could use this figure's methods to see if the regenerated planarian still exhibits a preference for that light color.\n",

        "caption": "FIGURE 6 | Morphogenesis as an example of collective intelligence and plasticity. The results of complex morphogenesis are the behavior in morphospace of a collective intelligence of cells. It is essential to understand this collective intelligence because by themselves, progress in molecular genetics is insufficient. For example, despite genomic information and much pathway data on the behavior of stem cells in planarian regeneration, there are no models predicting what happens when cells from a flat-headed species are injected into a round-headed species (A): what kind of head will they make, and will regeneration/remodeling ever stop, since the target morphology can never match what either set of cells expects? Development has the ability to overcome unpredictable perturbations to reach its goals in morphospace: tadpoles made with scrambled positions of craniofacial organs can make normal frogs (B) because the tissues will move from their abnormal starting positions in novel ways until a correct frog face is achieved(Vandenberg et al., 2012). This illustrates that the genetics seeds the development of hardware executing not an invariant set of movements but rather an error minimization (homeostatic) loop with reference to a stored anatomical setpoint (target morphology). The paths through morphospace are not unique, illustrated by the fact that when frog legs are induced to regenerate (C), the intermediate stages are not like the developmental path of limb development (forming a paddle and using programmed cell death to separate the digits) but rather like a plant (C ), in which a central core gives rise to digits growing as offshoots (green arrowheads) which nevertheless ends up being a very normal-looking frog leg(Tseng and Levin, 2013). (D) The plasticity extends across levels: when newt cells are made very large by induced polyploidy, they not only adjust the number of cells that work together to build kidney tubules with correct lumen diameter, but can call up a completely different molecular mechanism (cytoskeletal bending instead of cell:cell communication) to make a tubule consisting in cross-section of just 1 cell wrapped around itself; this illustrates intelligence of the collective, as it creatively deploys diverse lower-level modules to solve novel problems. The plasticity is not only structural but functional: when tadpoles are created to (E) have eyes on their tails (instead of in their heads), the animals can see very well(Blackiston and Levin, 2013), as revealed by their performance in visual learning paradigms (F). Such eyes are also competent modules: they first form correctly despite their aberrant neighbors (muscle, instead of brain), then put out optic nerves which they connect to the nearby spinal cord, and later they ignore the programmed cell death of the tail, riding it backward to end up on the posterior of the frog (G). All of this reveals the remarkable multi-scale competency of the system which can adapt to novel configurations on the fly, not requiring evolutionary timescales for adaptive functionality (and providing important buffering for mutations that make changes whose disruptive consequences are hidden from selection by the ability of modules to get their job done despite changes in their environment).

The result, after injury, will be a fully viable 2-headed worm (A -4). Importantly, the pattern shown in panel (A -3) is not a voltage map of the final 2-headed worm: it's a map of a 1-headed animal before cutting, which already has the induced false memory indicating that a correct worm should have 2 heads. In other words, the bioelectrics can diverge from the current state-it is not simply a readout of what the anatomy is doing now, but an orthogonal information medium that is used to guide future changes of anatomy. This information is latent, only guiding the cellular collective's anatomical homeostasis activity after injury. Thus it is also a basal example of counterfactual representation, referring to what should happen if an injury occurs, not what is happening now. Such changes to the bioelectric target morphology are true memories because they are re-writable but also long-term stable: if cut again, in water with no more channel-perturbing reagents, multiple rounds of regeneration of a genetically wild-type worm continue to give rise to 2-headed forms (B), which can be re-set back to normal by a different bioelectric perturbation(Oviedo et al., 2010). The control of morphology by bioelectric patterns is mediated as in the brain (C) by cells which have ion channels that set resting potential across the membrane (V mem ) and propagate those states in computational networks to their neighbors, via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. All cells, not just neurons (D) do this, and bioelectric signaling is an ancient information processing modality that pre-dates neurons and brains(Fields et al., 2020;Levin, 2021a). The ability of voltage states to functionally specify modular anatomy is seen when an ion channel is used to set membrane voltage in endodermal cells fated to be gut, to an eye-like bioelectric prepattern (E), which then create an eye on the gut (red arrowhead)(Pai et al., 2012). This phenomenon has 2 levels of instruction (F): in addition to our use of voltage to instruct shape at the organ level (not micromanaging individual eye components), the ion channel mRNA-injected cells (cyan \u03b2-galactose marker) further instruct their neighbors (brown cells) to participate in forming this ectopic lens.

        "analysis": "Here's an analysis of the figure, focusing on clarity and accessibility:\n\n1.  **Figure Description:**\n\nThe figure illustrates how bioelectrical patterns can act as a blueprint for regeneration and development, particularly in planarians (flatworms). Panel A shows that by manipulating the bioelectric state of a normal planarian, you can induce it to regenerate with two heads instead of one, even though its genes are normal. Panel B demonstrates that this \"memory\" of the two-headed form is stable and can be passed on through multiple rounds of regeneration, even without further bioelectrical manipulation. Panels C and D explain the mechanism: cells use ion channels to create voltage differences across their membranes, and these voltages can be communicated to neighboring cells via electrical synapses, forming a network that guides anatomical development. Panels E and F show that this principle extends beyond regeneration; by manipulating the voltage in gut cells of a developing embryo, you can induce the formation of an eye in an unusual location.\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings:**\n\n*   Bioelectrical patterns can override genetic instructions to determine the shape of regenerating planarians.\n*   These bioelectrical patterns can be artificially altered to create stable, heritable changes in morphology (e.g., two-headed worms).\n*   Cellular voltage gradients, mediated by ion channels and gap junctions, are a fundamental mechanism for information processing and pattern formation in development and regeneration.\n*   Bioelectric signals can instruct the formation of complex organs in ectopic locations.\n\n3.  **Relation to the Claim:**\n\nThe figure supports the podcast claim about planarian memory. Panel B shows that planarians can \"remember\" a bioelectrically induced two-headed form through multiple regeneration cycles. This suggests that memories can be encoded in the bioelectric state of the cells, rather than solely in the brain. Therefore, even if the head (and brain) is removed, the remaining body can still regenerate a new brain that retains the original information, as the bioelectric pattern acts as a template.\n",

        "caption": "FIGURE 9 | Gap junctions and the cellular collective. Communication via diffusible and biomechanical signals can be sensed by receptors at the membrane as messages coming from the outside of a cell (A). In contrast, cells coupled by gap junctions enable signals to pass directly from one cell's internal milieu into another. This forms a partial syncytium which helps erase informational boundaries between cells, as memory molecules (results of pathway dynamics) propagate across such cell groups without metadata on which cell originated them. The versatile gating of GJ synapses allows the formation of multicellular Selves that own memories of physiological past events at the tissue level (not just individual cells') and support larger target patterns, enabling them to cooperate to make complex organs (B). This process can break down: when oncogenes are expressed in tadpoles, voltage dye imaging (C) reveals the abnormal voltage state of cells that are disconnected bioelectrically from their neighbors, reverting to an ancient unicellular state (metastasis) that treats the rest of the body as external environment and grows out of control as tumors (D). This process can be prevented(Chernet and Levin, 2013a,b;Chernet et al., 2016) by artificially regulating their bioelectric state [e.g., co-injecting a hyperpolarizing channel with the oncogene, (E)]. In this case the tissue forms normally [(F), green arrow], despite the very strong presence of the oncogene [(G), red label]. This illustrates the instructive capacity of bioelectric networks to dominate single cell and genetic states to control large-scale tissue outcomes.

        "analysis": "Here's an analysis of the figure, focusing on clarity and accessibility:\n\n1.  **Figure Description:**\n\nThe figure illustrates how cells communicate and cooperate to form tissues and organs, and how disruptions in this communication can lead to cancer. It highlights the role of gap junctions (direct connections between cells) in sharing information and creating a collective \"memory\" at the tissue level. The figure contrasts this with how cancer cells, disconnected from the network, revert to a more individualistic state, treating the body as an external environment and forming tumors. The figure also shows how artificially regulating the bioelectric state of cells can prevent tumor formation, even in the presence of cancer-causing genes.\n\n2.  **Key Scientific Findings/Data Points:**\n\n*   **Gap junctions facilitate tissue-level memory:** Cells connected by gap junctions share signals and memory molecules, forming a collective memory that enables them to cooperate in building complex structures.\n*   **Cancer cells disconnect and revert:** Cancer cells lose their connections to the surrounding tissue, reverting to a more individualistic state and growing uncontrollably. Voltage dye imaging reveals the abnormal voltage state of these disconnected cells.\n*   **Bioelectric state can override genetic instructions:** Artificially regulating the bioelectric state of cells, such as by introducing a hyperpolarizing channel, can prevent tumor formation even when cancer-causing genes are present. This demonstrates the power of bioelectric networks to control tissue development.\n\n3.  **Relation to the Claim:**\n\nThe figure supports the general concept of tissue-level memory, which is relevant to the claim about planarian regeneration. While the figure focuses on cellular communication and cancer, the underlying principle is that information and memories can be stored and propagated at the tissue level, not just within individual cells. The planarian example suggests that this tissue-level memory can be retained even after significant physical changes, such as decapitation and regeneration, which aligns with the idea that memories are not solely localized to the brain but can be distributed throughout the organism.\n",
