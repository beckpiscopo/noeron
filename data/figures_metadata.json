In situ hybridization for XNr1 in untreated and concanamycin-treated Xenopus embryos Treatment of Xenopus embryos with the H + -V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin causes significant levels of heterotaxia that can be seen in the situs of organs at stage 45 (Fig. 1L), but disruptions of laterality can be detected much earlier by the expression patterns of normally left-sided markers. (A-D) Sectioned embryos processed for in situ hybridization with an XNr1 antisense probe. In wild-type embryos, XNr1 is restricted to the left (A); however, in inhibitor-treated embryos, its expression is randomized (B-D).

Three such channel combinations were the a Kir2.1 + leak, b Cav2.1 + Kir2.1 + leak, and c Cav2.2 + Kir2.1 + leak models. Note that Cav2.1 is a fast channel, and that A and C have effectively identical memory loci. In all of these models, voltages initialized in the physiological range converge on one of two locally stable voltages. The basins of attraction for these stable voltages are however, disconnected (in V), as initial hyperpolarization to -140 mV resulted in evolution to the higher-voltage memory",

This model is implemented on a fixed 10 \u00d7 10 grid with the left and right exterior boundaries mathematically identified to yield a cylindrical topology. This topology allows the two synchronized populations to \"wrap\" around the exterior border. The final model shown here was obtained by varying the left-right polarization bias parameter \"X\" while requiring two stable populations with no ectopic islands as output. This procedure allowed the value of the left-right polarization bias to the predicted to be 27%, consistent with observations(Levin et al., 2002;Adams et al., 2006). While the left-right border is represented at low resolution in the model and most solutions produce a straight, sharp boundary, this is not a biologically-meaningful constraint and the actual border between \"left\" and \"right\" cell populations in the embryo may be irregular as shown. The \"left-right communication\" model assumes that the two bioelectrically-synchronized sides exchange a long-range, oscillatory bioelectric signal; whether this signal requires an additional trigger for initiation is currently unknown. This model employs a small set of assumptions to quantitatively predict the tumor incidence expected when GJC is either suppressed by H7 or enhanced by Cx26. These predictions are then compared with experimental tumor frequencies (indicated by \"?\"). See Figure5for additional details of this model.",

For example, KRAS G12D and H7 expressions on opposite sides of the embryo (as shown in Figure2treatment C, and sections through a trunk tumor in Panel D) result in an increase in signaling from the H7-injected side and a consequent suppression in KRAS G12D -induced tumors on the opposite side (C,D). The stage-2 model can be visualized as a control network that regulates cellular response to KRAS G12D and both the production of ipsilateral signal (IS) and response to contralateral signal (CS). Here unlabeled flat-end arrows indicate a 100% suppressing effect (E). In this model, gap junctions are a central component, contributing to the long-range dynamics by allowing cells to sense neighbors' V mem . Cellular mechanisms corresponding to these arrows are not yet fully characterized; however, the butyrate-histone deacetylase pathway previously characterized in these embryos(Chernet and Levin, 2013a,b, 2014); is a plausible candidate for transducing the global bioelectrical signal into a local cellular response to KRAS G12D transformation.",

A moderately increased or decreased signal is not detrimental to the normal development of unperturbed embryos.

The 44% incidence is evenly split between two sides (22.45% incidence per injected side).

This includes the transcriptional space of gene expression (B) here schematized for two genes, anatomical morphospace (C) here schematized for two traits, and physiological space (D) here schematized for two parameters. An example (E) of problem-solving is planaria, which placed in barium (causing their heads to explode due to general blockade of potassium channels) regenerate new heads that are barium-insensitive(Emmons-Bell et al., 2019). They solve this entirely novel (not primed by evolutionary experience with barium) stressor by a very efficient traversal in transcriptional space to rapidly up/down regulate a very small number of genes that allows them to conduct their physiology despite the essential K + flux blockade. (F) The degree of intelligence of a system can be estimated by how effectively they navigate to optimal regions without being caught in a local maximum, illustrated as a dog which could achieve its goal on the other side of the fence, but this would require going around-temporarily getting further from its goal (a measurable degree of patience or foresight of any system in navigating its space, which can be visualized as a sort of energy barrier in the space, inset).

        "caption": "FIGURE 6 | Morphogenesis as an example of collective intelligence and plasticity. The results of complex morphogenesis are the behavior in morphospace of a collective intelligence of cells. It is essential to understand this collective intelligence because by themselves, progress in molecular genetics is insufficient. For example, despite genomic information and much pathway data on the behavior of stem cells in planarian regeneration, there are no models predicting what happens when cells from a flat-headed species are injected into a round-headed species (A): what kind of head will they make, and will regeneration/remodeling ever stop, since the target morphology can never match what either set of cells expects? Development has the ability to overcome unpredictable perturbations to reach its goals in morphospace: tadpoles made with scrambled positions of craniofacial organs can make normal frogs (B) because the tissues will move from their abnormal starting positions in novel ways until a correct frog face is achieved(Vandenberg et al., 2012). This illustrates that the genetics seeds the development of hardware executing not an invariant set of movements but rather an error minimization (homeostatic) loop with reference to a stored anatomical setpoint (target morphology). The paths through morphospace are not unique, illustrated by the fact that when frog legs are induced to regenerate (C), the intermediate stages are not like the developmental path of limb development (forming a paddle and using programmed cell death to separate the digits) but rather like a plant (C ), in which a central core gives rise to digits growing as offshoots (green arrowheads) which nevertheless ends up being a very normal-looking frog leg(Tseng and Levin, 2013). (D) The plasticity extends across levels: when newt cells are made very large by induced polyploidy, they not only adjust the number of cells that work together to build kidney tubules with correct lumen diameter, but can call up a completely different molecular mechanism (cytoskeletal bending instead of cell:cell communication) to make a tubule consisting in cross-section of just 1 cell wrapped around itself; this illustrates intelligence of the collective, as it creatively deploys diverse lower-level modules to solve novel problems. The plasticity is not only structural but functional: when tadpoles are created to (E) have eyes on their tails (instead of in their heads), the animals can see very well(Blackiston and Levin, 2013), as revealed by their performance in visual learning paradigms (F). Such eyes are also competent modules: they first form correctly despite their aberrant neighbors (muscle, instead of brain), then put out optic nerves which they connect to the nearby spinal cord, and later they ignore the programmed cell death of the tail, riding it backward to end up on the posterior of the frog (G). All of this reveals the remarkable multi-scale competency of the system which can adapt to novel configurations on the fly, not requiring evolutionary timescales for adaptive functionality (and providing important buffering for mutations that make changes whose disruptive consequences are hidden from selection by the ability of modules to get their job done despite changes in their environment).

        "caption": "FIGURE 7 | Bioelectrical pattern memories. Planarian fragments reliably regenerate whatever is missing, and stop when a correct worm is complete. Normal planaria (A) have 1 head and 1 tail (A-1), expression of anterior genes in the head (A-2), and a standing pattern of resting potential that depolarized on the end that should make a head [(A-3), revealed by voltage-reporting fluorescent dye, depolarized region marked with orange arrowhead]. When a middle portion is amputated, it regenerates to a correct 1-headed worm (A-4). It is possible to edit the information structure which encodes the target morphology (shape to which the fragments will regenerate). In worms that are anatomically normal (A -1), with normal gene expression (A -2), their bioelectric pattern can be altered in place [(A -3), orange arrowheads mark the two depolarized ends] using ion channel-targeting drugs or RNAi. The result, after injury, will be a fully viable 2-headed worm (A -4). Importantly, the pattern shown in panel (A -3) is not a voltage map of the final 2-headed worm: it's a map of a 1-headed animal before cutting, which already has the induced false memory indicating that a correct worm should have 2 heads. In other words, the bioelectrics can diverge from the current state-it is not simply a readout of what the anatomy is doing now, but an orthogonal information medium that is used to guide future changes of anatomy. This information is latent, only guiding the cellular collective's anatomical homeostasis activity after injury. Thus it is also a basal example of counterfactual representation, referring to what should happen if an injury occurs, not what is happening now. Such changes to the bioelectric target morphology are true memories because they are re-writable but also long-term stable: if cut again, in water with no more channel-perturbing reagents, multiple rounds of regeneration of a genetically wild-type worm continue to give rise to 2-headed forms (B), which can be re-set back to normal by a different bioelectric perturbation(Oviedo et al., 2010). The control of morphology by bioelectric patterns is mediated as in the brain (C) by cells which have ion channels that set resting potential across the membrane (V mem ) and propagate those states in computational networks to their neighbors, via electrical synapses known as gap junctions. All cells, not just neurons (D) do this, and bioelectric signaling is an ancient information processing modality that pre-dates neurons and brains(Fields et al., 2020;Levin, 2021a). The ability of voltage states to functionally specify modular anatomy is seen when an ion channel is used to set membrane voltage in endodermal cells fated to be gut, to an eye-like bioelectric prepattern (E), which then create an eye on the gut (red arrowhead)(Pai et al., 2012). This phenomenon has 2 levels of instruction (F): in addition to our use of voltage to instruct shape at the organ level (not micromanaging individual eye components), the ion channel mRNA-injected cells (cyan \u03b2-galactose marker) further instruct their neighbors (brown cells) to participate in forming this ectopic lens.

Still Images of cohorts of 15-75 cells per condition were analyzed with Microsoft Excel and Image J (National Institutes of Health, USA, RRID:SCR_003070) during 5 days. Fluorescence data was calculated as mean/area. As can be observed, in the R-treated cells intracellular Ca 2+ concentration decreases at day 1, (as compared to controls and to L-treated cells) and this difference is maintained along the 5 days (Kruskal-Wallis test for: L/R differences: p < 0.0001;Control/R differences: p < 0.001, indicated by asterisks). While L-treated cells, despite some fluctuations during days 2-3-4, do not significantly change from the untreated cells (Kruskal-Wallis test: Control/L differences: day 1, 2, 3 and 5: ns, day 4 p < 0.01). B The \u0394 fluorescence of A (initial fluorescence \u2212 final fluorescence) was measured at time 0 and 1440 min (24 h). This shows how R-treated cells decreased the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration, which is not observed in the other conditions. C Representative Ca 2+ fluorescence plot in real time, of single cells in L-and R-conditions, during 3 days.

Localized cellular asymmetry is propagated between cells to cause LR determinants to accumulate on one side of the embryonic midline, possibly by a process involving transport through gap junctions. These determinants would then induce cascades of factors in multicellular fields of the embryo (B). Finally, the asymmetric presence of these factors induces or suppresses asymmetrically located organs such as the spleen and regulates asymmetric morphogenesis of other organs such as the heart tube (C).",

Seven abnormalities were: middle head; side head; bipolar + middle head; side protrusion; bipolar head and double side head (color-coded at the top of the graph). Percentage of animals regenerating each pattern is displayed along with the number of animals (within parentheses) assayed in each condition (Roman numbers). Untreated animals always regenerated normally (not shown for simplicity). Most cases (3/4) where dissections did not disrupt VNC integrity at pre-pharyngeal level regenerated 100% normal animals (conditions I, II, VII and X). Conversely, almost all cases (7/8) where VNC integrity was disrupted in pre or post-pharyngeal area led to regeneration of abnormalities characterized by alterations in CNS patterning and polarity (conditions III-IX). These results suggest that VNC integrity and GJC play important role in regenerative patterning and polarity.",

Traditional sorting algorithms implemented as bottom-up drivers for cell behavior.In conventional sorting algorithms, a single top-down controller implements a set of rules to move cells around. We sought to study the sorting process in a more biologically-inspired architecture, where each cell is a competent agent implementing local policies. We thus defined three bottomup versions of common sort algorithms, where actions take place due to cells!#perspective (view) of their environment within the array. Shown here are examples of how cells are moved (traditional sort) or move themselves (cell-view sort) in each case. All cells have a chance to move at each time step (parallel). (A) In the traditional Bubble sort, the top-down controller chooses the first element on the left that is bigger than its right neighbor and keeps swapping it to the right until the right neighbor has larger or similar value, then repeats that process until all elements are in order. For the cell-view Bubble sort, all cells (elements) run in parallel and can compare their value with their neighbors#, and decide to swap to the left or right based on that value comparison. The sort is completed when no cell can move. (B) In the traditional Insertion sort, the controller splits the array into two parts: sorted and unsorted. At the beginning, only the first element on the left is considered %sorted\" and all remaining elements in the array are considered %unsorted\". For each step, the controller chose the left-most element from the unsorted part, and then keeps swapping it to the correct place in the sorted part of the array. In the cell-view Insertion sort, each cell knows all cells on its left, and starts to swap with its left neighbor (if its value is smaller) when all cells to its right are sorted. (C) In the traditional Selection sort, the controller finds the smallest element (for an increase sort) from unvisited elements and puts it into the next position of the sorted part of the array for each step. In the cell-view Selection sort, every cell tries to swap to its own ideal target position. The swap will be denied if the current cell at that position has a smaller value, and then the ideal position of the cell shifts the right of the original ideal position.",

        "caption": "Figure 8. Vibrations affect patterning of the left-right (LR) axis in two distinct ways, producing different phenotypes depending on the timing of treatment. Early events involved in the patterning of the LR axis have been split into three basic steps[1,42,94]: breaking of symmetry, orientation of the axes, and amplification/ restriction of LR signals. Targeting each of these steps is expected to produce different phenotypes: altered symmetry breaking leads to mirror-image left and right halves, i.e. isomerisms, a LR defect rarely if ever seen in Xenopus but often observed in mutant mice; altered orientation of the axes will produce a mixed population of wildtype and mirror-image individuals (with situs inversus) because the LR axis is randomly oriented with respect to the anterior-posterior and dorsalventral axes; altered amplification/restriction of LR signals will cause each organ to make independent decisions, thus producing a population of heterotaxic individuals. Here, we show that early vibrations produce large amounts of situs inversus, therefore we propose that the effects of early vibrations on the cytoskeleton are responsible for the second step, proper orientation of the three axes. The effects of vibrations during the second period of sensitivity largely produce heterotaxia, thus we propose that the effects of vibration on tight junction integrity, part of the ion flux pathway, alters the third step in the pathway, the amplification/restriction of LR signals. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0023306.g008",

(B) Model of cell response to electrophysiological modulation: Outer scaffolds contain a heterogeneous mixture of cells at various stages of differentiation.

This targeted subpopulation migrates into the center scaffold, where it then continues to respond to the reagent by up-or downregulating differentiation.",

The resulting mean traces are shown either superimposed (Fig 2A) or divided (Fig 2B) plotting the number of events on the x-axis. Mean \u03c4 H and % of dep. at s.s. values are summarized in Fig 2C and 2D in a frequency-dependent fashion. When we considered the number of events, other things being equal, higher stimulation frequencies were associated with a slower kinetic (Fig 2C; p<0.05 among groups) and more pronounced amplitude (Fig 2D and 2H; p<0.05). On the other hand, when we considered time rather than events as displayed on the x-axis (S4 Fig), higher stimulation frequency was associated with a faster kinetic (S4 Fig). From these results, the frequency of stimulation clearly affects both the kinetic and magnitude of the habituation profile indicating a frequency-dependent response. We also explored the impact of different intensities of stimulation on the habituation profile (bottom panel). HEK cells were stimulated at 1 Hz for 20 s at three different intensities: Low: 1V; Medium:2V; High:5V (bottom panel: black square, purple circle and green triangle, respectively). The resulting mean traces were shown superimposed (Fig 2E) or separated (Fig 2F) plotting the number of events on the x-axis; mean \u03c4 H and % of dep. at s.s. values are summarized in Fig 2G and 2H in an intensity-dependent fashion. Other factors being equal, at 1V the kinetic is significantly slower when compared to both 2V and 5V stimulations (Fig 2G). Moreover, at 1V the magnitude of habituation is less pronounced (p<0.05) than both 2V and 5V conditions (Fig 2H).

To better understand navigation competencies in unconventional organisms solving problems in unconventional spaces (e.g., embryos in morphological space), it is essential to construct comprehensive \"behavioral catalogs\" for these novel entities, which in turn requires sophisticated exploration methods to discover the extent of possible behaviors. Images are taken and adapted from[80] -[85] . (b) EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: We formalize GRN behavior as a navigation task and propose to investigate it by defining abstract and observer-dependent \"problem spaces\" that we use to organize the observed biological behaviors and their exploration in practice. (c) AUTOMATED EXPERIMENTATION: Pseudo-code of the curiosity-driven goal exploration process we use to automate the discovery of behavioral abilities that the GRN can exhibit in behavior space. (d) EMPIRICAL TESTS: We use a battery of empirical tests to identify the robust goal states of the systems, i.e. the one that can be attained under a wide variety of perturbation (including noise in gene expression, and pushes or walls during traversal of transcription space). (e) PERSPECTIVES: We explore several potential reuses of the discovered \"behavioral catalog\" and proposed framework across evolutionary biology, biomedicine and bioengineering contexts.",

(b)For the second variant, we implement walls as energy barriers acting as a new force field in the environment, constraining the GRN traversal of the space. This time, instead of having a discontinuous effect on the perpendicular speed \u03bd \u22a5 we define a wall force \u0192\u22a5 = \u00b1 \u03b1\u03bd \u22a5 (+ if \u03bd \u22a5 is going toward wall, -otherwise ) and use it to update the perpendicular component of the trajectory speed as \u03bd \u22a5 \u2190 \u03bd \u22a5 + \u0192 \u22a5 \u2022 \u0394T. Here \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u2212 2] and is calculated as a function of the distance between the point and the wall.

        "caption": "FIGURE 4 | Multicellularity: integrated Individuals arise from sharing bioelectrical information. (A) An individual cell perceives its local environment, and distinct cells perceive different local conditions. (B)When joined by gap junctions (electrical synapses), all of the cells have access to the same information, able to perceive states from the edge of the collective. This results in the ability of the system to react to and manipulate the large-scale environment in its homeostatic cycle. The ability to pursue spatio-temporally larger goals instantiates a bigger Individual with a different cognitive structure than any of the subunits. The sensory and set point conditions are scaled to the whole body, enabling maintenance of large anatomical features such as morphology. (C) The physiological coupling process can exhibit local breakdowns by loss of gap-junctional communication (which can be induced by oncogene activity) or by introducing physical barriers (which are known to induce cancer without any prior genetic damage). Individual cells thus disengage from the larger Individual, shrinking their cognitive horizon and reverting to their unicellular past resulting in over-proliferation and metastasis as the cell pursues its cell-level goals of individual survival. (D) Bacteria already had ion channels such as those used by metazoan cells, exploiting them and chemical receptors to sense their local environment in the same way that complex animals and plants use them as sensors. (E) Bacterial biofilms are proto-bodies, already using bioelectric signaling to enable time-sharing of nutrients across the collective -an early form of tissuelevel integrated goals(Prindle et al., 2015;Humphries et al., 2017;Lee et al., 2017;Liu et al., 2017).

However, if the blastoderm is temporarily scratched (a'), each island will, because it doesn't feel the presence of the others until the scratches heal, form its own embryo103 . This results in conjoined twins, triplets, etc. such as these two duck twins shown in b. Indeed (c), this fascinating process demonstrates that 1) the number of embryos emerging from the excitable medium of an embryonic blastoderm is not genetically fixed but determined in real-time by physiological processes, and 2) involves a fundamental process of collective autopoiesis in which each high-level individual (e.g., an embryo) needs to determine the borders between it and its outside world. d Such collective decisionmaking, which regulates the behavior of the subunits, and its failure modes, is starkly revealed as conjoined twins are known to often exhibit laterality defects (such as heterotaxy) as cells located between two self-organizing embryo collectives may not always decide correctly whether they are the left side of one twin or the right side of the other229 . e The same task is solved by individual organ primordia, for example when ectopic eyes are induced by ion channel misexpression150 , forming several distinct eyes of normal size instead of one giant eye.

When an arch is ablated, cells will move anteriorly or posteriorly instead of dorsoventrally to fill this missing arch thus achieving the correct target morphology of the collective behavior through movement patterns contrary to the individual cell's normal optimal path158,159 . Applying our perceptual field framework, the expanded collective perceptual field contains a more attractive path to achieving the cell's goal than its individual perceptual field does, and thus is undergoes compensatory rather than normal migration. Inter-domain grafting experiments demonstrate the expanded time-domain perceptual field of a collective intelligence (b). When grafted from one Hox domain to another, individual rhombomere or neural crest cells will lose the memory of their original Hox gene inductive event and adopt the expression pattern of their neighbors161,162 .

(A) In this study, we found that early HDAC activity between stages 1-7 is important to proper set the pattern of expression of XNr-1 at stage 21. In addition, we also show that HDAC activity and Mad3 are important on the right side of the embryo to set XNr-1's expression and that Mad's biological activity is dependent on 5HT. Despite HDAC and Mad3 mRNAs present a symmetric pattern of expression, one theory is that because 5HT is asymmetrically distributed in the right blastomeres at stage 7 (red), 5HT binding on Mad3 (blue) may recruit HDAC activity (orange) to the intronic region of XNr-1 on the right of the embryo. HDAC activity, at early developmental stages, may be important to decrease the levels of acetylation of histone H3 and H4 on the intronic region of Nr1. (B) At stage 21, low levels of acetylation on histones (H3 and H4), set by early HDAC activity, would contribute to repress the expression of Nr1, that will be expressed only on the left side of the embryo (blue box).

(C) shows that combined activity of dynamic channels with variable expression levels can generate resting Vmem bi-stability, as for cells with an original resting potential of \u221257 mV, expression of NaV channels with low expression of KV1.2 transitions the system into a depolarized Vmem of approximately \u221214 mV after a single forced depolarization.",

Panels C-G show close-ups of the anterior streak, node, and emerging notochord as indicated in b (hn = Hensen's node; ps = primitive streak). Control embryos (only cultured, or cultured and electroporated with a control morpholino) exhibited the normal left-sided Shh pattern (c). In contrast, embryos treated with the Vangl2 morpholino often exhibited bilateral (d) or absent (e) expression of Shh at the node. In panel E, note the expression of Shh in the notochord anterior to the node, demonstrating that lack of Shh expression in Hensen's node is not due to a failure of in situ hybridization. While most published patterns of Shh expression, even when randomized by modulation of various pathways, exhibit expression that is entirely on or entirely off on each side of the Node (f), Vangl2 morpholinos often induced a speckled pattern in the node (g), indicating a failure of the cells on one side of the node to come to a synchronized (coherent) decision about their sidedness.

Understanding this 'goal-directed' activity is an important open problem in biological control.The least action principle can predict the emergence of form, in terms of the flow or paths of least action in biological systems. For example, in colonies, ants find the paths of least action to harvest food and bring it to the colony. This example considers their paths as flow channels, or trajectories, finding the least average action for each instance of foraging, given available resources. More generally, minimization of action in an open system leads to structure formation. The 'flows' in such (dissipative) systems are of energy, matter and constituent elements along the paths of least action. An open dynamical system tends towards its state of least action, or the 'most action efficient state'. A canonical example of the emergence of such dissipative structures is when a moving fluid (e.g., a river) erodes obstructions to its flow to form a network of flow channels.",

The active states are given by the underlying active components of the cytoskeleton, such as actin filaments and microtubules. By associating the gradient flows of the Markov blanket partition with Bayesian belief updating, self-organization of internal states -in response to sensory fluctuations -can be thought of as perception, while active states couple internal states back to hidden external states vicariously, to provide a mathematical formulation of action and behavior.

(b)This process is usually described as a feed-forward system where the activity of gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) within cells results in the expression of effector proteins that, via structural properties of proteins and physical forces, will result in the emergence of complex shape. This class of models (bottom-up process driven by self-organization and parallel activity of large numbers of local agents) is difficult to apply to several biological phenomena. Regulative development can alter subsequent steps to reach the correct anatomical goal state despite drastic deviations of the starting state. (c) For example, mammalian embryos can be divided in half, giving rise to perfectly normal monozygotic twins each of which has regenerated the missing cell mass. (d ) Mammalian embryos can also be combined, giving rise to a normal embryo in which no parts are duplicated. (e) Such capabilities suggest that pattern control is fundamentally a homeostatic process-a closed-loop system using feedback to minimize the error (distance) between a current shape and a target morphology. Although these kinds of decision-making models are commonplace in engineering, they are only recently beginning to be employed in biology\u2026. This kind of pattern-homeostatic process must store a setpoint that serves as a stop condition; however, as with most types of memory, it can be specifically modified by experience. ( f ) In the phenomenon of trophic memory, damage created at a specific point on the branched structure of deer antlers is recalled as ectopic branch points in subsequent years' antler regeneration. This reveals the ability of cells at the scalp to remember the spatial location of specific damage events and alter cell behaviour to adjust the resulting pattern appropriately-a pattern memory that stretches across months of time and considerable spatial distance and is able to modify low-level (cellular) growth rules to construct a pre-determined stored pattern that differs from the genome-default for this species. (g) A similar capability was recently shown in a molecularly tractable model system\u2026, in which genetically normal planarian flatworms were bioelectrically reprogrammed to regenerate two-headed animals when cut in subsequent rounds of asexual reproduction in plain water. (h) The decision making revealed by the cells, tissues and organs in these examples of dynamic remodelling toward specific target states could be implemented by cybernetic processes at various positions along a scale of proto-cognitive complexity\u2026.

        "caption": "Fig.4 Bioelectric machinery underlying morphogenetic control. A The computational architecture of the nervous system relies on a network of cells, which set their resting potential via ion channels in their membrane, and communicates that state via controllable electrical synapses known as gap junctions[299]. B This machinery is ancient, with all body cells having resting potential across their membrane (V mem ) mediated by the same ion channels and most cells making gap junctional connections to form bioelectrical networks[188]. C This interface can be manipulated in any tissue in the same way as neuroscientists probe brain tissues: using molecular reagents to control connectivity (via opening and closing gap junctions) or directly setting voltage states by opening and closing ion channels (using drugs or optogenetic light stimulation). Also, the downstream messengers (neurotransmitters) operating in many tissues can be controlled directly[300,301]. D An example of imaging of the bioelectrical prepatterns that define morphogenetic setpoints is the \"electric face\" revealed by signals from a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye that indicates the future positions of the gene expressions, and subsequent anatomical structures, of the early frog embryo anterior ectoderm. This pattern is instructive because if it is shifted artificially and induces the predictable changes in subsequent development. Note the simplicity of the encoding-the bioelectrical states represent high-level order (elements of the target morphology for regulative development), such as the location of an \"eye\" or \"mouth\", not the state of gene expression or individual stem cell fate. E The bioelectric representation of the target morphology guiding the cellular collective can work as a counterfactual memory, as in the example of the cryptic planaria: animals with normal one-headed anatomy and gene expression, but a two-headed target morphology representation in the bioelectric circuit (shown here using the voltage dye imaging), which causes them to build two-headed animals if cut into fragments[193]. F The bioelectric prepattern is a true memory because, despite the wild-type genetic sequence, fragments from two-headed animals continue to generate two-headed animals in perpetuity (with no more treatments)[195]-this is an example of the software layer that is reprogrammable and enabled by the genetically specified ion channel hardware, which does not need to change to be shifted to an entirely different large-scale target morphology. G Not only can head number be reprogrammed by a brief physiological stimulus to the morphogenetic agent, but also head shape: an animal with a triangular head shape can be shifted toward morphologies (including brain shape and stem cell distribution)[197,198] of other species with round or flat heads. This enables the cellular collective to explore attractors in morphospace (G'), using the exact same genome, which eventually could become canalized into genetically distinct species.

The basics of bioelectricity.The familiar components of electrical signaling in neurons include resting potential, generated by the activity of ion channels in the cell membrane, and the electrical synapse which allows current to flow into neighboring cells (A). These electrical synapses occur in the CNS alongside the much more familiar chemical synapses[136][137][138], but are especially crucial outside of excitable tissues for cell regulation and tumor suppression[139][140][141][142]. These same components are present in most somatic cells (B), which likewise generate resting potentials and share them with their neighbors using the exact same ion channel and gap junction proteins. Even non-excitable tissues are composed of cell networks (C) in which cells coordinate activity and execute group decision-making during pattern generation and maintenance. These networks signal via the voltage-dependent movement of small molecules such as serotonin and other neurotransmitters. All of these components have been implicated in various stages of the cancer process. The result of this signaling is growth control, differentiation, pattern regulation -processes that go awry in cancer. Molecular tools now exist for manipulating bioelectric state of cells (intrinsic plasticity), connectivity of the bioelectric network (synaptic plasticity), or the movement of neurotransmitters within the tissue (network activity).

Spatial patterns of resting potential can be detected in vivo using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes. Here, a fluorescent voltage reporter (Rhodamine 6G dye[143,144], courtesy of Douglas J. Blackiston) applied to a stage 44 frog embryo (Xenopus laevis) illustrates an anterior-posterior physiological gradient across the middle flank of a frog tadpole.

        "caption": "Fig.(5). Feedback between bioelectrics and gene regulatory networks regulates patterning. Cells are regulated by at least two layers of activity: the molecular genetic and the bioelectric (A). The molecular-genetic layer of pattern control is implemented by gene regulatory networks in which transcription factors control each other's expression. The bioelectric layer of control is formed by the reciprocal interactions between ion channels and gap junctions, and cell resting potential: Vmem is determined by channels and electrical synapses, and at the same time, Vmem determines the gating properties of voltage sensitive channels and gap junctions. Thus, every cell has the opportunity to drive positive feedback loops that can amplify small differences (useful for spontaneous symmetry breaking) or negative feedback loops that confer stability and robustness to environmental stimuli. The genetic and bioelectric layers are functionally coupled, since Vmem changes can alter transcription of downstream target genes[146,147], while changes in the transcription of ion channel genes alter electric circuit dynamics. Recent data have shown that manipulation of the complex dynamics of the bioelectrical layer reveal its endogenous patterning functions, resulting in the production of frogs with ectopic limbs (B), flatworms with 4 heads (C), or tadpoles in which gut tissue has been reprogrammed into complete eyes (D)[32,46].

Because aberrant bioelectric signaling is an early component of the carcinogenic process, this transformation is observed via voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye signaling (B, closeup in B) in vivo, revealing the tumor sites and margins before they become anatomically apparent. Consistent with a reversion of cancer into a unicellular phenotype, a wide range of data[149,150] reveal that tumor cells, like stem and early embryonic cells, tend to be depolarized while mature, quiescent somatic cells tend to be hyperpolarized (C). Importantly, it is now known that this relationship is not merely a marker, but is actually functionally determinative of cell behavior[51,52,63,151]. Panels A-B' are taken from[63].

In the context of a wild-type genome, the normally small number of round melanocytes seen in sections through the anterior torso (A) and the tail (B) become highly arborized and over-proliferative (C, D). These cells become highly migratory, invading the brain and neural tube (E, red arrows) and extend long processes as they reach throughout lateral tissues (F, red arrow). They also invade blood vessels, which are normally free of melanocytes (G) but become choked with these cells after depolarization by pharmacological agents[61] or injection of dominant negative potassium channel subunits (H). These animals' normal vasculature (I) also begins to overgrow (J). Together, these data reveal that depolarization can trigger the key aspects of metastatic melanoma: rapid over-growth, cell shape change, and invasiveness.

Mechanistic dissection of this process[60] revealed that the long-range communication is mediated by the voltage-dependent release of serotonin from instructor cells (a widely-distributed population that, when depolarized, releases serotonin that activates genes such as SLUG and other aspects of epithelial-tomesenchymal transition in normal melanocytes).

This occurs by prevention of tumor formation and tumor normalization. Such therapies, especially when combined with novel chemical strategies to render ion cannels light-gated without the use of gene therapy[156,157], are a promising novel path forward for cancer treatments that focus on tumor reprogramming instead of targeted toxicity.

At the physiological scale neural cells signal via fast high-magnitude changes in membrane potential. Developing cells communicate via membrane potential fluctuations, though these changes are far slower and lower in magnitude. Cancer cells tend to depolarize over time, facilitating oncogenesis. At the local scale, neurons communicate directly with myocytes via gap junctions or translate bioelectric signals into chemical signals via vesicular release. Normal and cancerous non-neural cells likewise communicate at long distances via thin membrane protrusions (TMPs), gap junctions, and exosomes. At long-distance neurons form networks capable of complex computation regulated by the pruning activity of macrophages. Macrophages also establish networks of signaling projections between different types of skin cells during development and facilitate priming of the metastatic niche during cancer metastasis.",

(A) A conventional view of evolution models individual evolutionary units in a population. The complexity of the environment is not \"visible\" to evolution -selection on an individual (orange circle) responds only to corresponding additive effects of selection in the environment (orange square) (large arrows). At the population level, this is formally equivalent to simple (model-free) forms of learning and inference(Frank, 2009;Harper, 2009;Shalizi, 2009). (B) When individual traits affect behavioural or phenotypic interactions with other individuals, these relationships can evolve to \"mirror\" dependencies among environmental variables. When interactions are reciprocal (single-level) the evolution of the community is formally equivalent to shallow models of connectionist learning(Watson et al., 2014Power et al., 2015;Kouvaris et al., 2017). (C) We hypothesise that when functional interactions between individuals in a community are directional, creating deep interaction structures with \"hidden\" variables, evolution is formally equivalent to deep model induction. When evolved functions are non-linearly separable, and their outputs control the coordination of particle reproduction, the hierarchical structures so created constitute new individuals at a higher level of organisation (e.g., green). The functional interactions between component individuals constitute a developmental process for this higher-level individual, and enable information integration and collective actions at a new level of biological organisation. Adaptations under natural selection (acting on deep variables, red circles) now serve the development, survival and reproduction of the new individual (large arrows), and deep causal variables in development (red circles) mirror deep causal variables in the selective environment (red squares).",

        "caption": "FIGURE 2 | Overview of conventional models of evolution (A), previous work in evolutionary connectionism (B) and Hypothesis 1 (C). (A) A conventional view of evolution models individual evolutionary units in a population. The complexity of the environment is not \"visible\" to evolution -selection on an individual (orange circle) responds only to corresponding additive effects of selection in the environment (orange square) (large arrows). At the population level, this is formally equivalent to simple (model-free) forms of learning and inference(Frank, 2009;Harper, 2009;Shalizi, 2009). (B) When individual traits affect behavioural or phenotypic interactions with other individuals, these relationships can evolve to \"mirror\" dependencies among environmental variables. When interactions are reciprocal (single-level) the evolution of the community is formally equivalent to shallow models of connectionist learning(Watson et al., 2014Power et al., 2015;Kouvaris et al., 2017). (C) We hypothesise that when functional interactions between individuals in a community are directional, creating deep interaction structures with \"hidden\" variables, evolution is formally equivalent to deep model induction. When evolved functions are non-linearly separable, and their outputs control the coordination of particle reproduction, the hierarchical structures so created constitute new individuals at a higher level of organisation (e.g., green). The functional interactions between component individuals constitute a developmental process for this higher-level individual, and enable information integration and collective actions at a new level of biological organisation. Adaptations under natural selection (acting on deep variables, red circles) now serve the development, survival and reproduction of the new individual (large arrows), and deep causal variables in development (red circles) mirror deep causal variables in the selective environment (red squares).",

Complex, flexible, goal-seeking behavior (A) is implemented by information processing in the brain (B), which consists of networks of electrically communicating neural cells networks executing physiological circuits (C), which operate because of electrically gated ion channel and electrical synapse proteins (D). Similarly, large-scale goal-directed pattern remodeling and regeneration (E) occurs via bioelectric gradients that coordinate cell activity (F), implemented by physiological circuits in non-neural cells (G) which operate because of the same set of ion channels and electrical synapses (H). The behavior of these systems at the lowest level is achieved by regulating gap junction state and ion channel activity in specific cells (I). Circuit activity is beginning to be tractable in both contexts using optogenetics (J). In behavioral settings, the most effective path toward desired outcomes is to interact with the system at the highest level, rewarding for desired behavior (K).

(A) A parsimonious model of the data proposes that KCNE1 modifies the function of KCNQ1, which up-regulates Sox10 and its downstream targets, such as XSlug. These factors are known to be necessary and sufficient for the observed up-regulation of proliferation, change in cell shape, and induction of invasive migration behavior in melanocytes. (B) Embryonic regions expressing KCNE1 induce up-regulation of key transcription factors, such as Sox10 and Slug, in other cells in the neural crest population, which confers upon them a hyperproliferative, invasive phenotype. This illustrates a non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which ion flows are transduced into canonical transcription cascades that control cell behavior. Black dashed lines indicate migration of hyperproliferating offspring of the target (green) cell. The original event takes place in the cell expressing KCNE1 (blue), which does not itself contribute all of the proliferative offspring. The target cell may induce the XSox10 pathway in neighbors by conventional biochemical signals (e.g., BMPs, FGFs, and WNTs). The direct biophysical interaction occurs in the target cell, where KCNE1-mediated loss of membrane polarization is relayed to the downstream signaling machinery by cell-autonomous mechanisms.",
