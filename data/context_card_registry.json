      "transcript_text": "But you know, that's, that's exactly what we're trying to half ass when we, when we judge judgment of beauty by facial symmetry, that's, that's a half assed assessment of exactly that. Of exactly that. Because if your cells could not cooperate enough to keep your, your organism symmetrical. Yeah. You know, you can make some inferences about what else is wrong. Right. Like that's a, that's a very, you know, that's a very basic, interesting. Yeah. So that in some deep sense, actually that is what we're doing. We're trying to infer how the health. We use the word healthy, but basically how functional is this biological system looking at so I can hook up with that one and make offspring. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what kind of hardware might their genomics give me that might be useful in the future? I wonder why evolution didn't give us higher resolution signal. Like why the whole peacock thing with the feathers, it doesn't seem, it's a very low bandwidth signal. For sexual selection. I'm gonna, and I'm not an expert on this stuff, but on peacocks? Well, no, you know, but, but I'll take a stab at the reason. I, I think that it's because it's an arms race. You see, you don't want everybody to know everything about you. So I think that as much as, and in fact there's another interesting part of this arms race which is if you think about this, the most adaptive evolvable system is one that has the most level of top down control. If it's really easy to say to a bunch of cells, make another finger versus okay, here's 10,000 gene expression changes that you need to do to make to change your finger. Right. The, with good top down control that has memory. And we need to get back to that, by the way. That's a question I neglected to answer about where the memory is and so on. A system that uses all of that is really highly evolvable and that's fantastic. But guess what? It's also highly subject to hijacking by parasites, by cheaters of various kinds, by conspecifics. We found that. And then that goes back to the story of the pattern memory in these planaria. There's a bacterium that lives on these planaria. That bacterium has an input into how many heads the worm is going to have because it hijacks that, that control system and it's able to make a chemical that basically interfaces with the system, that calculates how many heads you're supposed to have. And they can have two, and they can make them have two heads. And so you can imagine that if you are too. So you want to be understandable for your own parts to understand each other, but you don't want to be too understandable because you'll be too easily controllable. And so I think that, my guess is that the, that that opposing pressure keeps this from being a super high bandwidth kind of thing where we could just look at somebody and know, know everything about them. So it's a kind of biological game of Texas hold'. Em. Yeah, you're showing some cards and you're hiding other cards and that's part of it. And there's bluffing and there's, and all that and then there's probably whole species that would do way too much bluffing. That's probably where peacocks fall. I, there's a, there's a book that I don't remember if I read or if I, if I wrote if I read summaries of the book, but it's about evolution of beauty and birds. Where's that from? Is that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk about it? But basically there's some species started to like over select for beauty. Not over select, they just some reason select for beauty. There is a case to be made, actually. Now I'm starting to remember. I think Darwin himself made a case that you can select based on beauty alone. So yeah, that beauty. There's a point where B doesn't represent some underlying biological truth. You start to select for, for beauty itself. And I think the, the deep question is there is some, is there some evolutionary value to beauty? But it's an interesting kind of thought that this. Can we deviate completely from the deep biological truth to actually appreciate some kind of the, the summarization in itself? Let me get back to memory because this is a really interesting idea. How do a collection of cells remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine?",

They're not like earthworms. They're much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they're these little. They're about maybe 2 centimeters in the centimeter to 2 in size. They have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are immortal, so they do not age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that. Well, over time everything degrades. No planaria can keep it going for probably, you know, how long have they been around? 400 million years. Right. So these are the actual. So the planaria in our lab are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago. The following is a conversation with Michael Levin, one of the most fascinating and brilliant biologists I've ever talked to. He and his lab at Tufts University works on novel ways to understand and control complex pattern formation in biological systems. Andrej Karpathy, a world class AI researcher, is the person who first introduced me to Michael Levin's work. I bring this up because these two people make me realize that biology has a lot to teach us about AI, and AI might have a lot to teach us about biology. This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Michael Levin. Embryogenesis is the process of building the human body from a single cell. I think it's one of the most incredible things that exists on earth from a single embryo. So how does this process work? Yeah, it is an incredible process. I think it's maybe the most magical process there is. And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that it shows that each of us takes the journey from so called just physics to mind, because we all start life as a single quiescent unfertilized oocyte. And it's basically a bag of chemicals. And you look at that and you say, okay, this is chemistry and physics. And then nine months and some years later you have an organism with high level cognition and preferences and inner life and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is gradual, it's smooth. There is no special place where, you know, a lightning bolt says boom. Now you've gone from physics to true cognition. That doesn't happen. And so we can see in this process that the whole mystery, you know, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically how you get mind from matter from. Just physics in quotes. Yeah. So where's the magic to the thing? How do we get from information encoded in DNA and make physical reality out of that information? So one of the things that I think is really important if we're going to bring in DNA into this picture is to think about the fact that what DNA encodes is the hardware of life. DNA contains the instructions for the kind of micro level hardware that every cell gets to play with. So all the proteins, all the signaling factors, the ion channels, all the cool little pieces of hardware that cells have, that's what's in the DNA. The rest of in so called generic laws. And these are laws of mathematics, these are laws of computation, these are laws of physics of all kinds of interesting things that are not directly in the DNA. And that process. I think the reason I always put just physics in quotes is because I don't think there is such a thing as just physics. I think that thinking about these things in binary categories like this is physics, this is true cognition, this is as if it's only faking these kinds of things. I think that's what gets us in trouble. I think that we really have to understand that it's a continuum and we have to work up the scaling, the laws of scaling, and we can certainly talk about that. There's a lot of really interesting thoughts to be had there.",

There's a lot of really interesting thoughts to be had there. So the physics is deeply integrated with the information. So the DNA doesn't exist on its own. The DNA is integrated in some sense in response to the laws of physics at every scale. The laws of the environment it exists in. Yeah, the environment and also the laws of the universe. I mean, the thing about the DNA is that once evolution discovers a certain kind of machine, that if the physical implementation is appropriate, it sort of. And this is hard to talk about because we don't have a good vocabulary for this yet, but it's a very kind of platonic notion that if the machine is there, it pulls down interesting things that you do not have to evolve from scratch because the laws of physics give it to you for free. So just as a really stupid example, if you're trying to evolve a particular triangle, you can evolve the first angle and you evolve the second angle, but you don't need to evolve the third. You know what it is already. Now why do you know that's a gift for free from geometry in a particular space, you know what that angle has to be. And if you evolve an ion channel, which is. Ion channels are basically transistors, right? They're voltage gated current conductances. If you evolve that ion channel, you immediately get to use things like truth tables, you get logic functions, you don't have to evolve the logic function, you don't have to evolve a truth table. It doesn't have to be in the DNA, you get it for free, right? And the fact that if you have NAND gates, you can build anything you want, you get that for free. All you have to evolve is that first step, that first little machine that enables you to couple to those laws and there's laws of adhesion and many other things. And this is all that interplay between the hardware that's set up by the genetics and the software that's based, the physiological software that basically does all the computation and the cognition and everything else is a real interplay between the information and the DNA and the laws of physics, of computation and so on.",

      "transcript_text": "So the physics is deeply integrated with the information. So the DNA doesn't exist on its own. The DNA is integrated in some sense in response to the laws of physics at every scale. The laws of the environment it exists in. Yeah, the environment and also the laws of the universe. I mean, the thing about the DNA is that once evolution discovers a certain kind of machine, that if the physical implementation is appropriate, it sort of. And this is hard to talk about because we don't have a good vocabulary for this yet, but it's a very kind of platonic notion that if the machine is there, it pulls down interesting things that you do not have to evolve from scratch because the laws of physics give it to you for free. So just as a really stupid example, if you're trying to evolve a particular triangle, you can evolve the first angle and you evolve the second angle, but you don't need to evolve the third. You know what it is already. Now why do you know that's a gift for free from geometry in a particular space, you know what that angle has to be. And if you evolve an ion channel, which is. Ion channels are basically transistors, right? They're voltage gated current conductances. If you evolve that ion channel, you immediately get to use things like truth tables, you get logic functions, you don't have to evolve the logic function, you don't have to evolve a truth table. It doesn't have to be in the DNA, you get it for free, right? And the fact that if you have NAND gates, you can build anything you want, you get that for free. All you have to evolve is that first step, that first little machine that enables you to couple to those laws and there's laws of adhesion and many other things. And this is all that interplay between the hardware that's set up by the genetics and the software that's based, the physiological software that basically does all the computation and the cognition and everything else is a real interplay between the information and the DNA and the laws of physics, of computation and so on. So is it fair to say, just like this idea that the laws of mathematics are discovered, they're latent within the fabric of the universe, in that same way the laws of biology are kind of discovered? Yeah, I think that's absolutely. And it's probably not a popular view, but I think that's right on the money. Yeah, well, I think that's a really deep idea then. Embryogenesis is the process of revealing, of embodying, of manifesting these laws. You're not building the laws, you're just creating the capacity to reveal. Yes, I think, again, not the standard view of molecular biology by any means, but I think that's right on the money. I'll give you a simple example. Some of our latest work with these xenobots, right? So what we've done is to take some skin cells off of an early frog embryo and basically ask about their plasticity. If we give you a chance to sort of reboot your multicellularity in a different context, what would you do? Because what you might assume by the thing about embryogenesis is that it's super reliable, right? It's very robust. And that really obscures some of its most interesting features. We get used to it. We get used to the fact that acorns make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs. And we say, well, what else is it going to make that's what it makes. That's a standard story. But the reality is, and so you look at these, at these skin cells and you say, well what do they know how to do? Well they know how to be a passive, boring, two dimensional outer layer keeping the bacteria from getting into the embryo. That's what they know how to do. Well, it turns out that if you take these skin cells and you remove the rest of the embryo, so you remove all of the rest of the cells and you say, well, you're by yourself now, what do you want to do? So what they do is they form this multi little creature that runs around the dish. They have all kinds of incredible capacities. They navigate through mazes, they have various behaviors that they do both independently. They have a. Basically they implement von Neumann's dream of self replication. Because if you sprinkle a bunch of loose cells into the dish, what they do is they run around, they collect those cells into little piles, they sort of mush them together until those little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So you've got this machine that builds copies of itself from loose material in its environment. None of this are things that you would have expected from the frog genome. In fact, the genome is wild type. There's nothing wrong with their genetics. Nothing has been added, no nanomaterials, no genomic editing, nothing. And so what we have done there is engineer by subtraction. What you've done is you removed the other cells that normally basically bully these cells into being skin cells and you find out that what they really want to do is to be this. Their default behavior is to be a xenobot. But in vivo in the embryo, they get told to be skinned by these other cell types. Now here comes this really interesting question that you just posed. When you ask where does the form of the tadpole and the frog come from? The standard answer is, well, it's selection. So over millions of years it's been shaped to produce the specific body that's fit for froggy environments. Where does the shape of the xenobot come from? There's never been any xenobots. There's never been selection to be a good xenobot. These cells find themselves in the new environment in 48 hours. They figure out how to be an entirely different proto organism with new capacities like kinematic self replication. That's not how frogs or tadpoles replicate. We've made it impossible for them to replic replicate their normal way. Within a couple days, these guys find a new way of doing it that's not done anywhere else in the biosphere.",

      "transcript_text": "Yes, I think, again, not the standard view of molecular biology by any means, but I think that's right on the money. I'll give you a simple example. Some of our latest work with these xenobots, right? So what we've done is to take some skin cells off of an early frog embryo and basically ask about their plasticity. If we give you a chance to sort of reboot your multicellularity in a different context, what would you do? Because what you might assume by the thing about embryogenesis is that it's super reliable, right? It's very robust. And that really obscures some of its most interesting features. We get used to it. We get used to the fact that acorns make oak trees and frog eggs make frogs. And we say, well, what else is it going to make that's what it makes. That's a standard story. But the reality is, and so you look at these, at these skin cells and you say, well what do they know how to do? Well they know how to be a passive, boring, two dimensional outer layer keeping the bacteria from getting into the embryo. That's what they know how to do. Well, it turns out that if you take these skin cells and you remove the rest of the embryo, so you remove all of the rest of the cells and you say, well, you're by yourself now, what do you want to do? So what they do is they form this multi little creature that runs around the dish. They have all kinds of incredible capacities. They navigate through mazes, they have various behaviors that they do both independently. They have a. Basically they implement von Neumann's dream of self replication. Because if you sprinkle a bunch of loose cells into the dish, what they do is they run around, they collect those cells into little piles, they sort of mush them together until those little piles become the next generation of xenobots. So you've got this machine that builds copies of itself from loose material in its environment. None of this are things that you would have expected from the frog genome. In fact, the genome is wild type. There's nothing wrong with their genetics. Nothing has been added, no nanomaterials, no genomic editing, nothing. And so what we have done there is engineer by subtraction. What you've done is you removed the other cells that normally basically bully these cells into being skin cells and you find out that what they really want to do is to be this. Their default behavior is to be a xenobot. But in vivo in the embryo, they get told to be skinned by these other cell types. Now here comes this really interesting question that you just posed. When you ask where does the form of the tadpole and the frog come from? The standard answer is, well, it's selection. So over millions of years it's been shaped to produce the specific body that's fit for froggy environments. Where does the shape of the xenobot come from? There's never been any xenobots. There's never been selection to be a good xenobot. These cells find themselves in the new environment in 48 hours. They figure out how to be an entirely different proto organism with new capacities like kinematic self replication. That's not how frogs or tadpoles replicate. We've made it impossible for them to replic replicate their normal way. Within a couple days, these guys find a new way of doing it that's not done anywhere else in the biosphere. Well, actually, let's step back and define what are xenobots? So a xenobot is a self assembling little proto organism. It's also a biological robot. Those things are not distinct. It's a member of both classes. How much is it biology? How much is it robot? At this point, most of it is biology because what we're doing is we're discovering natural behaviors of the cells and also of the cell collectives. Now, one of the really important parts of this was that we're working together with Josh Baungaert's group at University of Vermont. They're computer scientists, do AI and they've basically been able to use an evolutionary, a simulated evolution approach to ask how can we manipulate these cells, give them signals, not rewire their DNA. So not hardware, but experience signals. So can we remove some cells, can we add some cells, can we poke them in different ways to get them to do other things? So in the future there be. We're now, and this is future unpublished work, but we're doing all sorts of interesting ways to reprogram them to new behaviors. But before you can start to reprogram these things, you have to understand what their innate capacities are. Okay, so that means engineering, programming. You're engineering them in the future. And in some sense the definition of a robot is something you, in part engineer versus evolve. I mean, it's such a fuzzy definition anyway. In some sense, many of the organisms within our body are kinds of robots. Yes, yes. And I think robots is a weird line because it's. We tend to see robots as the other. I think there will be a time in the future when there's going to be something akin to the civil rights movements for robots. But we'll talk about that later perhaps. Sure. Anyway, so how do you. Can we just linger on it? How do you build a xenobot? What are we talking about here? From whence does it start? And how does it become the glorious xenobot?",

The thing is, we are now moving from old school engineering, which used passive materials, wood, metal, things like this, that basically the only thing you could depend on is that they were going to keep their shape. That's it. They don't do anything else. It's on you as an engineer to make them do everything they're going to do. And then there were active materials and now computational. This is a whole new era. These are agential materials. You're now collaborating with your substrate because your material has an agenda. These cells have billions of years of evolution. They have goals, they have preferences. They're not just going to sit where you put them. That's hilarious that you have to talk your material into keeping its sh. That's it. That is exactly right. That is exactly right. That is. It's like getting a bunch of cats or something and trying to organize a sheep out of them. It's funny we're on the same page here because in a paper, this is. This has currently just been accepted in nature bioengineering. One of the figures I have is building a tower out of Legos versus dogs, right? So think about the difference, right? If you build out of Legos, you have full control over where it's going to go. But if somebody knocks it over, it's game over with the dogs. You cannot just come and stack them. They're not going to stay that way. But the good news is that if you train them, then somebody knocks it over, they'll give it right back up. So it's all about. So as an engineer, what you really want to know is what can I depend on this thing to do? Right? That's really. A lot of people have definitions of robots as far as what they're made of or how they got here, Design versus evolve, whatever. I don't think any of that is useful. I think as an engineer, what you want to know is how much can I depend on this thing to do when I'm not around to micromanage it? What level of. What level of dependency can I give this thing? How much agency does it have? Which then tells you, what techniques do you use? So do you use micromanagement? Like you put everything where it goes, do you train it, do you give it signals, do you try to convince it to do things right? How intelligent is your substrate? And so now we're moving into this area where you're working with agential materials. That's a collaboration, that's not old style.",

Like you put everything where it goes, do you train it, do you give it signals, do you try to convince it to do things right? How intelligent is your substrate? And so now we're moving into this area where you're working with agential materials. That's a collaboration, that's not old style. What's the word you're using? Agential. Agential. What's that mean? Agency. It comes from the word agency. So basically the material has agency meaning that it has some level of, obviously not human level, but some level of preferences, goals, memories, ability to remember things, to compute into the future, meaning, anticipate, when you're working with cells, they have all of that to various degrees. Is that empowering or Limiting having material that has a mind of its own. Literally, I think it's both, right? So it raises difficulties because it means that if you're using the old mindset, which is a linear kind of extrapolation of what's going to happen, you're going to be surprised and shocked all the time. Because biology does not do what we linearly expect materials to do. On the other hand, it's massively liberating. And so in the following way, I've argued that advances in regenerative medicine require us to take advantage of this, because what it means is that you can get the material to do things that you don't know how to micromanage. So just as a simple example, right, if you, if you had a rat and you wanted this rat to do a circus trick, put a ball in the little hoop, you can do it the micromanagement way, which is try to control every neuron and try to play the thing like a puppet, and maybe someday that'll be possible, maybe. Or you can train the rat. And this is why humanity, for thousands of years before we knew any neuroscience, we had no idea what's between the ears of any animal. We were able to train these animals because once you recognize the level of agency of a certain system, you can use appropriate techniques. If you know the currency of motivation, reward and punishment, you know how smart it is, you know what kinds of things it likes to do, you are searching a much more, much smoother, much nicer problem space than if you try to micromanage the thing. And in regenerative medicine, when you're trying to get, let's say, an arm to grow back or an eye to repair a cell birth defect or something? Do you really want to be controlling tens of thousands of genes at each point to try to micromanage it, or do you want to find the high level modular controls that say, build an arm. Here, you already know how to build an arm. You did it before, do it again. So I think it's both, it's both difficult and it challenges us to develop new ways of engineering. And it's, it's hugely empowering.",

      "transcript_text": "Literally, I think it's both, right? So it raises difficulties because it means that if you're using the old mindset, which is a linear kind of extrapolation of what's going to happen, you're going to be surprised and shocked all the time. Because biology does not do what we linearly expect materials to do. On the other hand, it's massively liberating. And so in the following way, I've argued that advances in regenerative medicine require us to take advantage of this, because what it means is that you can get the material to do things that you don't know how to micromanage. So just as a simple example, right, if you, if you had a rat and you wanted this rat to do a circus trick, put a ball in the little hoop, you can do it the micromanagement way, which is try to control every neuron and try to play the thing like a puppet, and maybe someday that'll be possible, maybe. Or you can train the rat. And this is why humanity, for thousands of years before we knew any neuroscience, we had no idea what's between the ears of any animal. We were able to train these animals because once you recognize the level of agency of a certain system, you can use appropriate techniques. If you know the currency of motivation, reward and punishment, you know how smart it is, you know what kinds of things it likes to do, you are searching a much more, much smoother, much nicer problem space than if you try to micromanage the thing. And in regenerative medicine, when you're trying to get, let's say, an arm to grow back or an eye to repair a cell birth defect or something? Do you really want to be controlling tens of thousands of genes at each point to try to micromanage it, or do you want to find the high level modular controls that say, build an arm. Here, you already know how to build an arm. You did it before, do it again. So I think it's both, it's both difficult and it challenges us to develop new ways of engineering. And it's, it's hugely empowering. Okay, so how do you do, I mean, maybe sticking with the metaphor of dogs and cats, I presume you have to figure out the find the dogs and dispose of the cats. Because, you know, it's like the old herding cats is an issue. So you may be able to train dogs. I suspect you will not be able to train cats. Or if you do, you're never going to be able to trust Them. So is there a way to figure out which material is amenable to herding? Is it in the lab work or is it in simulation? Right now it's largely in the lab because we are, our simulations do not capture yet the most interesting and powerful things about biology. So the simulation, what we're pretty good at simulating are feed forward emergent types of things, right? So cellular automata, if you have simple rules and you sort of roll those forward for every agent or every cell in the simulation, then complex things happen. You know, ant colony algorithms, things like that. We're good at that and that's fine. The difficulty with all of that is that it's incredibly hard to reverse. So this is a really hard inverse problem, right? If you look at a bunch of termites and they make a thing with a single chimney and you say, well I like it, but I'd like two chimneys, how do you change the rules of behavior? Free termites, so they make two chimneys. Or if you say here are a bunch of cells that are creating this kind of organism, I don't think that's optimal. I'd like to repair that birth defect. How do you control all the individual low level rules, all the protein interactions and everything else? Rolling it back from the anatomy that you want to the low level hardware rules is in general intractable. It's an inverse problem that's generally not solvable. Right now it's mostly in the lab because what we need to do is we need to understand how biology uses top down controls. So the idea is not bottom up emergence, but the idea of things like goal directed, test operate, exit kinds of loops where it's basically an error minimization function over a new space, not a space of gene expression, but for example a space of anatomy. So just as a simple example, if you have a salamander and it's got an arm, you can amputate that arm anywhere along the length of it will grow exactly what's needed and then it stops. That's the most amazing thing about regeneration, is that it stops. It knows when to stop, when does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander arm has been completed. So that tells you that's a means ends kind of analysis where it has to know what the correct limb is supposed to look like. So it has a way to ascertain the current shape, it has a way to measure that delta from what shape it's supposed to be. And then it will keep taking actions, meaning remodeling and growing and everything else until that's complete. So once you know that, and we've taken advantage of this in the lab to do some really wild things with both planaria and frog embryos and so on. Once you know that, you can start playing with that homeostatic cycle. You can ask, for example, well, how does it remember what the correct shape is? And can we mess with that memory? Can we give it a false memory of what the shape should be and let the cells build something else? Or can we mess with the measurement apparatus? Right, so it gives you those kinds of. So the idea is to basically appropriate a lot of the approaches and concepts from cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science into things that previously were taken to be dumb materials. And you get yelled at in class for being anthropomorphic if you said, well, my cells want to do this and my cells want to do that. And I think that's a major mistake.

      "transcript_text": "Right now it's largely in the lab because we are, our simulations do not capture yet the most interesting and powerful things about biology. So the simulation, what we're pretty good at simulating are feed forward emergent types of things, right? So cellular automata, if you have simple rules and you sort of roll those forward for every agent or every cell in the simulation, then complex things happen. You know, ant colony algorithms, things like that. We're good at that and that's fine. The difficulty with all of that is that it's incredibly hard to reverse. So this is a really hard inverse problem, right? If you look at a bunch of termites and they make a thing with a single chimney and you say, well I like it, but I'd like two chimneys, how do you change the rules of behavior? Free termites, so they make two chimneys. Or if you say here are a bunch of cells that are creating this kind of organism, I don't think that's optimal. I'd like to repair that birth defect. How do you control all the individual low level rules, all the protein interactions and everything else? Rolling it back from the anatomy that you want to the low level hardware rules is in general intractable. It's an inverse problem that's generally not solvable. Right now it's mostly in the lab because what we need to do is we need to understand how biology uses top down controls. So the idea is not bottom up emergence, but the idea of things like goal directed, test operate, exit kinds of loops where it's basically an error minimization function over a new space, not a space of gene expression, but for example a space of anatomy. So just as a simple example, if you have a salamander and it's got an arm, you can amputate that arm anywhere along the length of it will grow exactly what's needed and then it stops. That's the most amazing thing about regeneration, is that it stops. It knows when to stop, when does it stop? It stops when a correct salamander arm has been completed. So that tells you that's a means ends kind of analysis where it has to know what the correct limb is supposed to look like. So it has a way to ascertain the current shape, it has a way to measure that delta from what shape it's supposed to be. And then it will keep taking actions, meaning remodeling and growing and everything else until that's complete. So once you know that, and we've taken advantage of this in the lab to do some really wild things with both planaria and frog embryos and so on. Once you know that, you can start playing with that homeostatic cycle. You can ask, for example, well, how does it remember what the correct shape is? And can we mess with that memory? Can we give it a false memory of what the shape should be and let the cells build something else? Or can we mess with the measurement apparatus? Right, so it gives you those kinds of. So the idea is to basically appropriate a lot of the approaches and concepts from cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science into things that previously were taken to be dumb materials. And you get yelled at in class for being anthropomorphic if you said, well, my cells want to do this and my cells want to do that. And I think that's a major mistake. That leaves a ton of capabilities on the table. So thinking about biological systems as things that have memory, have almost something like cognitive ability. But I mean, how incredible is it, you know, that the salamander arm is being rebuilt? Not with a dictator. It's kind of like the cellular automata system. All the individual workers are doing their own thing. So where's that top down signal that does the control coming from? Like, how can you find it? Why does it stop growing? How does it know the shape? How does it have memory of the shape? And how does it tell everybody to be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, we're done. So the first thing to think about, I think, is that there are no examples anywhere of a central dictator in this kind of science, because everything is made of parts. And so we, even though we feel as a unified, central sort of intelligence and kind of point of cognition, we are a bag of neurons, right? All intelligence is collective intelligence. This is important to think about because a lot of people think, okay, there's real intelligence, like me, and then there's collective intelligence, which is ants and flocks of birds and termites and things like that. And maybe it's appropriate to think of them as an individual. And maybe it's not. A lot of people are skeptical about that and so on. But you've got to realize that we are not. There's no such thing as this indivisible diamond of intelligence that's like this one central thing that's not made of parts. We are all made of parts. And so if you believe, which I think is hard to get around, that we in fact have a centralized set of goals and preferences, and we Plan and we do things and so on. You are already committed to the fact that a collection of cells is able to do this because we are a collection of cells. There's no getting around that. In our case, what we do is we navigate the three dimensional world and we have behavior. This is blowing my mind right now. Because we are just a collection of cells. Oh, yeah, yeah. So when I'm moving this arm, I feel like I'm the central dictator of that action. But there's a lot of stuff going on. Like every, all, all the cells here are collaborating in some interesting way. They're getting signal from the central nervous system.",

They're getting signal from the central nervous system. Well, even the central nervous system is misleadingly named because it isn't really central. Again, it's just a bunch of cells. It's just a bunch of cells. I mean, all of the. Right. There are no singular indivisible intelligences anywhere. We are all, every. Every example that we've ever seen is a collective of some of something. It's just that we're used to it. We're used to that. You know, we're used to, okay, this thing is kind of a single thing, but it's really not. You zoom in, you know what you see? You see a bunch of cells running around. And so is there some unifying? I mean, we're just jumping around. But that something that you look as the bioelectrical signal versus the biochemical, the chemistry, the electricity, maybe the life is in that versus the cells. There's an orchestra playing and the resulting music is the dictator. That's not bad. That's Dennis Noble's kind of view of things. He has two really good books where he talks about this musical analogy, right? So I think I like it. I like it. Is it wrong, though? I don't think it's. No, I don't think it's wrong. I don't think it's wrong. I think the important thing about it is that we have to come to grips with the fact that a true proper cognitive intelligence can still be made of parts. Those things are. And in fact, it has to be. And I think it's a real shame, but I see this all the time. When you have a collective like this, whether it be a group of robots or a collection of cells or neurons or whatever, as soon as we gain some insight into how it works, right? Meaning that, oh, I see. In order to take this action, here's the information that got processed via this chemical mechanism or whatever. Immediately people say, oh, well, then that's not real cognition. That's just physics. I think this is fundamentally flawed because if you zoom into anything, what are you going to see? Of course, you're just going to see physics. What else could be underneath? Right. It's not going to be fairy dust. It's going to be physics and chemistry. But that doesn't take away from the magic of the fact that there are certain ways to arrange that physics and chemistry, and in particular the bioelectricity, which I like a lot to give you an emergent collective with goals and preferences and memories and anticipations that do not belong to any of the subunits. So I think what we're getting into here, and we can talk about how this happens during embryogenesis and so on, what we're getting into is the origin of the. Of. Of a self. Yeah. With a big. With a capital S. So we ourselves, there are many other kinds of selves and we can tell some really interesting stories about where selves come from and how they become unified.",

      "transcript_text": "That's not bad. That's Dennis Noble's kind of view of things. He has two really good books where he talks about this musical analogy, right? So I think I like it. I like it. Is it wrong, though? I don't think it's. No, I don't think it's wrong. I don't think it's wrong. I think the important thing about it is that we have to come to grips with the fact that a true proper cognitive intelligence can still be made of parts. Those things are. And in fact, it has to be. And I think it's a real shame, but I see this all the time. When you have a collective like this, whether it be a group of robots or a collection of cells or neurons or whatever, as soon as we gain some insight into how it works, right? Meaning that, oh, I see. In order to take this action, here's the information that got processed via this chemical mechanism or whatever. Immediately people say, oh, well, then that's not real cognition. That's just physics. I think this is fundamentally flawed because if you zoom into anything, what are you going to see? Of course, you're just going to see physics. What else could be underneath? Right. It's not going to be fairy dust. It's going to be physics and chemistry. But that doesn't take away from the magic of the fact that there are certain ways to arrange that physics and chemistry, and in particular the bioelectricity, which I like a lot to give you an emergent collective with goals and preferences and memories and anticipations that do not belong to any of the subunits. So I think what we're getting into here, and we can talk about how this happens during embryogenesis and so on, what we're getting into is the origin of the. Of. Of a self. Yeah. With a big. With a capital S. So we ourselves, there are many other kinds of selves and we can tell some really interesting stories about where selves come from and how they become unified. Yeah. Is this the first, or at least humans tend to think that this is the. The level of which the self with a capital S is first born. But. And we really don't want to see human civilization or Earth itself as one living organism. Yeah. That's very uncomfortable to us. It is, yeah. But is. Yeah. Where's the self born? We have to grow up past that. So what I like to do is. Well, I'll tell you two quick stories about that. I like to roll backwards. So. So as opposed to. So if you start and you say, okay, here's a paramecium, and you see it, you know, it's a single cell organism, you see it doing various things and people will say, okay, I'm sure there's some chemical story to be told about how it's doing it. So if that's not true cognition. Right. And people will argue about that, but I like to work it backwards. I say, let's agree that you and I as we sit here are examples of true cognition. If anything is. If there's anything that's true cognition, we are examples of it. Now let's just roll back slowly. Right? So you roll back to the time when you were a small child and used to doing whatever, and then just sort of day by day you roll back and eventually you become more or less that paramecium, and then you sort of even below that. Right. As an unfertilized osa. So no one has, to my knowledge, no one has come up with any convincing discrete step at which my cognitive powers disappear. Right. It Just doesn't, the biology doesn't offer any specific step. It's incredibly smooth and slow and continuous. And so I think this idea that it just sort of magically shows up at one point and then, and then, you know, humans have true selves that don't exist elsewhere. I think it runs against everything we know about evolution, everything we know about developmental biology. These are all slow continua. And the other really important story I want to tell is where embryos come from. So think about this for a second. Amniote embryo. So this is humans, birds and so on, mammals and birds and so on. Imagine a flat disk of cells. So there's maybe 50,000 cells. And in that. So when you get an egg from a fertilized, let's say you buy a fertilized egg from a farm, right? That egg will, will have about 50,000 cells in a flat disk. Looks like a little, tiny little frisbee in that flat disk. What will happen is there'll be one set of cells will become special and it will tell all the other cells, I'm going to be the head, you guys don't be the head. And so it'll amplify, symmetry breaking amplification. You get one embryo, there's some neural tissue and some other stuff forms. Now you say, okay, I had one egg and one embryo, and there you go. What else could it be? Well, the reality is, and I did all of this as a grad student, if you take a little needle and you make a scratch in that blastoderm, in that disc, such that the cells can't talk to each other for a while, it heals up. But for a while they can't talk to each other. What'll happen is that both regions will decide that they can be the embryo and there will be two of them. And then when they heal up, they become conjoint twins. And you can make two, you can make three, you can make lots. So the question of how many selves are in there cannot be answered until it's actually played all the way through. It isn't necessarily that there's just one, there can be many. So what you have is you have this medium, this undifferentiated. I'm sure there's a psychological version of this somewhere that I don't know the proper terminology, but you have this ocean of potentiality. You have these thousands of cells and some number of individuals are going to be formed out of it. Usually one, sometimes zero, sometimes several. And they form out of these cells because a region of these Cells organizes into a collective that will have goals, goals that individual cells don't have. For example, make a limb, make an eye. How many eyes? Well, exactly two. Individual cells don't know what an eye is. They don't know how many eyes you're supposed to have, but the collective does. The collective has goals and memories and anticipations that the individual cells don't. And the establishment of that boundary with its own ability to pursue certain goals, that's the origin of selfhood.",

      "transcript_text": "But is. Yeah. Where's the self born? We have to grow up past that. So what I like to do is. Well, I'll tell you two quick stories about that. I like to roll backwards. So. So as opposed to. So if you start and you say, okay, here's a paramecium, and you see it, you know, it's a single cell organism, you see it doing various things and people will say, okay, I'm sure there's some chemical story to be told about how it's doing it. So if that's not true cognition. Right. And people will argue about that, but I like to work it backwards. I say, let's agree that you and I as we sit here are examples of true cognition. If anything is. If there's anything that's true cognition, we are examples of it. Now let's just roll back slowly. Right? So you roll back to the time when you were a small child and used to doing whatever, and then just sort of day by day you roll back and eventually you become more or less that paramecium, and then you sort of even below that. Right. As an unfertilized osa. So no one has, to my knowledge, no one has come up with any convincing discrete step at which my cognitive powers disappear. Right. It Just doesn't, the biology doesn't offer any specific step. It's incredibly smooth and slow and continuous. And so I think this idea that it just sort of magically shows up at one point and then, and then, you know, humans have true selves that don't exist elsewhere. I think it runs against everything we know about evolution, everything we know about developmental biology. These are all slow continua. And the other really important story I want to tell is where embryos come from. So think about this for a second. Amniote embryo. So this is humans, birds and so on, mammals and birds and so on. Imagine a flat disk of cells. So there's maybe 50,000 cells. And in that. So when you get an egg from a fertilized, let's say you buy a fertilized egg from a farm, right? That egg will, will have about 50,000 cells in a flat disk. Looks like a little, tiny little frisbee in that flat disk. What will happen is there'll be one set of cells will become special and it will tell all the other cells, I'm going to be the head, you guys don't be the head. And so it'll amplify, symmetry breaking amplification. You get one embryo, there's some neural tissue and some other stuff forms. Now you say, okay, I had one egg and one embryo, and there you go. What else could it be? Well, the reality is, and I did all of this as a grad student, if you take a little needle and you make a scratch in that blastoderm, in that disc, such that the cells can't talk to each other for a while, it heals up. But for a while they can't talk to each other. What'll happen is that both regions will decide that they can be the embryo and there will be two of them. And then when they heal up, they become conjoint twins. And you can make two, you can make three, you can make lots. So the question of how many selves are in there cannot be answered until it's actually played all the way through. It isn't necessarily that there's just one, there can be many. So what you have is you have this medium, this undifferentiated. I'm sure there's a psychological version of this somewhere that I don't know the proper terminology, but you have this ocean of potentiality. You have these thousands of cells and some number of individuals are going to be formed out of it. Usually one, sometimes zero, sometimes several. And they form out of these cells because a region of these Cells organizes into a collective that will have goals, goals that individual cells don't have. For example, make a limb, make an eye. How many eyes? Well, exactly two. Individual cells don't know what an eye is. They don't know how many eyes you're supposed to have, but the collective does. The collective has goals and memories and anticipations that the individual cells don't. And the establishment of that boundary with its own ability to pursue certain goals, that's the origin of selfhood.",

Are they discovering that goal? Where the hell did evolution discover this? When you went from the prokaryotes to eukaryotic cells and then they started making groups. And when you make a certain group, you make a. You, you make it sound. And such a tricky thing to try to understand. You make it sound like this. Cells didn't get together and came up with a goal. But the very act of them getting together revealed the goal that was always there. There was always that potential for that goal. So the first thing to say is that there are way more questions here than certainties. Okay? So everything I'm telling you is cutting edge developing stuff. So it's not as if any of us know the answer. But here's my opinion on this. I think what evolution. I don't think that evolution produces solutions to specific problems. In other words, specific environments. Like here's a frog that can live well in a froggy environment. I think what evolution produces is problem solving machines that will solve problems in different spaces. So not just three dimensional space. This goes back to what we were talking about before. The brain is evolutionarily a late development. It's a system that is able to pursue goals in three dimensional space by giving commands to muscles. Where did that system come from? That system evolved from a much more ancient, evolutionarily, much more ancient system where collections of cells gave instructions for cell behaviors, meaning cells move to divide, to die, to change into different cell types, to navigate morphous space, the space of anatomies, the space of all possible anatomies. And before that, cells were navigating transcriptional space, which is a space of all possible gene expressions. And before that, metabolic space. So what evolution has done, I think, is produced hardware that is very good at navigating different spaces using a bag of tricks, which I'm sure many of them we can steal for autonomous vehicles and robotics and various things. And what happens is that they navigate these spaces without a whole lot of commitment to what the space is. In fact, they don't know what the space is. We are all brains in a vat, so to speak. Every cell does not know. Every cell is some other cell's external environment. So where does that border between you, you and the outside world? You don't really know where that is. Every collection themselves has to figure that out from scratch. And the fact that evolution requires all of these things to figure out what they are, what effectors they have, what sensors they have, where does it make sense to draw a boundary between me and the outside world? The fact that you have to build all that from scratch. This autopoiesis is what defines the border of a self. Now, biology uses a multi scale competency architecture, meaning that every level has goals. So molecular networks have goals, cells have goals, tissues, organs, colonies, and it's the interplay of all of those that enable biology to solve problems in new ways. For example, in xenobots and various other things. This is, you know, it's exactly as you said. In many ways the cells are discovering new ways of being, but at the same time, evolution certainly shapes all this. So evolution is very good at this agential bioengineering. Right. When evolution is discovering a new way of being an animal or a plant or something, sometimes it's by changing the hardware, changing protein structure and so on. But much of the time it's not by changing the hardware, it's by changing the signals that the cells give to each other. It's doing what we as engineers do, which is try to convince the cells to do various things by using signals, experiences, stimuli. That's what biology does. It has to, because it's not dealing with a blank slate every time. If you're evolution and you're trying to make an organism, you're not dealing with a passive material that is fresh. And you have to specify it already wants to do certain things. So the easiest way to do that search to find whatever is going to be adaptive is to find the signals that are going to convince itself to do various things. Right.",

Now, biology uses a multi scale competency architecture, meaning that every level has goals. So molecular networks have goals, cells have goals, tissues, organs, colonies, and it's the interplay of all of those that enable biology to solve problems in new ways. For example, in xenobots and various other things. This is, you know, it's exactly as you said. In many ways the cells are discovering new ways of being, but at the same time, evolution certainly shapes all this. So evolution is very good at this agential bioengineering. Right. When evolution is discovering a new way of being an animal or a plant or something, sometimes it's by changing the hardware, changing protein structure and so on. But much of the time it's not by changing the hardware, it's by changing the signals that the cells give to each other. It's doing what we as engineers do, which is try to convince the cells to do various things by using signals, experiences, stimuli. That's what biology does. It has to, because it's not dealing with a blank slate every time. If you're evolution and you're trying to make an organism, you're not dealing with a passive material that is fresh. And you have to specify it already wants to do certain things. So the easiest way to do that search to find whatever is going to be adaptive is to find the signals that are going to convince itself to do various things. Right.",

      "transcript_text": "So the first thing to say is that there are way more questions here than certainties. Okay? So everything I'm telling you is cutting edge developing stuff. So it's not as if any of us know the answer. But here's my opinion on this. I think what evolution. I don't think that evolution produces solutions to specific problems. In other words, specific environments. Like here's a frog that can live well in a froggy environment. I think what evolution produces is problem solving machines that will solve problems in different spaces. So not just three dimensional space. This goes back to what we were talking about before. The brain is evolutionarily a late development. It's a system that is able to pursue goals in three dimensional space by giving commands to muscles. Where did that system come from? That system evolved from a much more ancient, evolutionarily, much more ancient system where collections of cells gave instructions for cell behaviors, meaning cells move to divide, to die, to change into different cell types, to navigate morphous space, the space of anatomies, the space of all possible anatomies. And before that, cells were navigating transcriptional space, which is a space of all possible gene expressions. And before that, metabolic space. So what evolution has done, I think, is produced hardware that is very good at navigating different spaces using a bag of tricks, which I'm sure many of them we can steal for autonomous vehicles and robotics and various things. And what happens is that they navigate these spaces without a whole lot of commitment to what the space is. In fact, they don't know what the space is. We are all brains in a vat, so to speak. Every cell does not know. Every cell is some other cell's external environment. So where does that border between you, you and the outside world? You don't really know where that is. Every collection themselves has to figure that out from scratch. And the fact that evolution requires all of these things to figure out what they are, what effectors they have, what sensors they have, where does it make sense to draw a boundary between me and the outside world? The fact that you have to build all that from scratch. This autopoiesis is what defines the border of a self. Now, biology uses a multi scale competency architecture, meaning that every level has goals. So molecular networks have goals, cells have goals, tissues, organs, colonies, and it's the interplay of all of those that enable biology to solve problems in new ways. For example, in xenobots and various other things. This is, you know, it's exactly as you said. In many ways the cells are discovering new ways of being, but at the same time, evolution certainly shapes all this. So evolution is very good at this agential bioengineering. Right. When evolution is discovering a new way of being an animal or a plant or something, sometimes it's by changing the hardware, changing protein structure and so on. But much of the time it's not by changing the hardware, it's by changing the signals that the cells give to each other. It's doing what we as engineers do, which is try to convince the cells to do various things by using signals, experiences, stimuli. That's what biology does. It has to, because it's not dealing with a blank slate every time. If you're evolution and you're trying to make an organism, you're not dealing with a passive material that is fresh. And you have to specify it already wants to do certain things. So the easiest way to do that search to find whatever is going to be adaptive is to find the signals that are going to convince itself to do various things. Right. Your sense is that evolution operates both in the software and the hardware, and it's just easier and more efficient to operate in the software. Yes, and I should also say I don't think the distinction is sharp. In other words, I think it's a continuum, but I think it's a meaningful distinction where you can make changes to a particular protein and now the enzymatic function is different and it metabolizes differently and whatever, and that will have implications for fitness. Or you can change the huge amount of information in the genome that isn't structural at all, it's signaling. It's when and how do cells say certain things to each other. And that can have massive changes as far as how it's going to solve problems. I mean, this idea of multi hierarchical competence architecture, which is incredible to think about. So this hierarchy that evolution builds, I don't know who's responsible for this. I also see the incompetence of bureaucracies of humans when they get together. So how the hell does evolution build this? Where at every level only the best get to stick around. They somehow figure out how to do their job without knowing the bigger picture. And then there's like the bosses that do the bigger thing somehow. Or that you can now abstract away the small group of cells as a, as an organ or something, and then that organ does something bigger in the context of the full body or something like this. How is that built? Is there some intuition you can kind of provide of how that's constructed? That hierarchical competence architecture? I love that competence. Just the word competence is pretty cool in this context because everybody's good at their job somehow.",

      "transcript_text": "Yes, and I should also say I don't think the distinction is sharp. In other words, I think it's a continuum, but I think it's a meaningful distinction where you can make changes to a particular protein and now the enzymatic function is different and it metabolizes differently and whatever, and that will have implications for fitness. Or you can change the huge amount of information in the genome that isn't structural at all, it's signaling. It's when and how do cells say certain things to each other. And that can have massive changes as far as how it's going to solve problems. I mean, this idea of multi hierarchical competence architecture, which is incredible to think about. So this hierarchy that evolution builds, I don't know who's responsible for this. I also see the incompetence of bureaucracies of humans when they get together. So how the hell does evolution build this? Where at every level only the best get to stick around. They somehow figure out how to do their job without knowing the bigger picture. And then there's like the bosses that do the bigger thing somehow. Or that you can now abstract away the small group of cells as a, as an organ or something, and then that organ does something bigger in the context of the full body or something like this. How is that built? Is there some intuition you can kind of provide of how that's constructed? That hierarchical competence architecture? I love that competence. Just the word competence is pretty cool in this context because everybody's good at their job somehow. Yeah, no, it's really key. And the other nice thing about competency is that. So my central belief in all of this is that engineering is the right perspective on all of this stuff because it gets you away from subjective terms. People talk about sentience and this and that, those things very hard to define. People argue about them philosophically. I think that engineering terms like competency, like pursuit of goals, all of these things are empirically incredibly useful because you know it when you see it and if it helps you build. If I can pick the right level, I say this thing has, I believe this is X level of competency. I think it's like a thermostat, or I think it's like a better thermostat, or I think it's various other kinds of. There's many different kinds of complex systems. If that helps me to control and predict and build such systems, then that's all there is to say. There's no more philosophy to argue about. So I like competency in that way because you can quantify. In fact, you have to, you have to make a claim competent at what? And then. Or if I say, if I tell you it has a goal, the question is what's the goal? And how do you know? And I say, well, because every time I deviated from this particular state, that's what it spends energy to get back to. That's the goal. And we can quantify it and we can be objective about it. So we're not used to thinking about this. I give a talk sometimes called why don't robots get cancer? Right. And the reason robots don't get cancer is because, generally speaking, with a few exceptions, our architectures have been, you've got a bunch of dumb parts and you hope that if you put them together, the overlying machine will have some intelligence and do something or other. But the individual parts don't care. They don't have an agenda. Biology isn't like that. Every level has an agenda. And the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition both within and across levels. So, for example, during embryogenesis, your tissues and organs are competing with each other. And it's actually a really important part of development. There's a reason they compete with each other. They're not all just helping each other. They're also competing for information, for limited metabolic constraints. But to get back to your other point, which is this seems really efficient and good and so on compared to some of our human efforts. We also have to keep in mind that what happens here is that each level bends the option space for the level beneath, so that your parts, basically, they don't see the geometry. And I think I take this seriously. Terminology from relativity where the space is literally bent. So the option space is deformed by the higher level, so that. But the lower levels, all they really have to do is go down their concentration gradient. They don't have to. In fact, they don't. They can't know what the big picture is. But if you bend the space just right, if they do what locally seems right, they end up doing your bidding. They end up doing things that are optimal in the higher space. Conversely, because the components are good at getting their job done, you as the higher level, don't need to try to compute all the low level controls. All you're doing is bending the space. You don't know or care how they're going to do it. Give you a super simple example. In the tadpole, we found that, okay, so tadpoles need to become frogs. And to go from a tadpole head to a frog head, you have to rearrange the face. So the eyes have to move forward, the jaws have to come out, the nostrils move, like everything moves. It used to be thought that because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same, if you just remember, if every piece just moves in the right direction, the right amount, then you get your frog right. So we decided to test. I had this hypothesis that I thought actually the System's probably more intelligent than that. So what did we do? We made what we call Picasso tadpoles. So everything is scrambled. So the eyes are on the back of the head, the jaws are off to the side. Everything is scrambled. Well, guess what they make? They make pretty normal frogs because all the different things move around in novel paths, configurations, until they get to the correct froggy sort of frog face configuration. Then they stop. So the thing about that is, now imagine evolution. So you make some sort of mutation. And like every mutation, it does many things, so something good comes of it. But also it moves your mouth off to the side, right? Now, if there wasn't this multiscale competency, you can see where this is going. If there wasn't this multiscale competency, the organism would be dead. Your fitness is zero because you can't eat. And you would never get to explore the other beneficial consequences of that mutation. You'd have to wait until you find some other way of doing it without moving the mouth. That's really hard. So the fitness landscape would be incredibly rugged. Evolution would take forever. The reason it works, one of the reasons it works so well is because you do that, no worries, the mouth will find its way where it belongs, right? So now you get to explore. So what that means is that all of these mutations that otherwise would be deleterious are now neutral, because the competency of the parts make up for all kinds of things. So all the noise of development, all the variability in the environment, all these things, the competency of the parts makes up for it. So that's all fantastic, right? That's all great. The only other thing to remember when we compare this to human efforts is this. Every component has its own goals in various spaces, usually with very little regard for the welfare of the other levels. So as a simple example, you, as a complex system, you will go out and you will do jiu jitsu or whatever, you'll have some go. You have to go rock climbing and scrape a bunch of cells off your hands. And then you're happy as a system, you come back and you've accomplished some goals and you're really happy. Those cells are dead. They're gone. Right? Did you think about those cells? Not really. Right. You had some bruising al selfish sob. That's it. And so that's the thing to remember is that, and we know this from history, is that just being a collective isn't enough. Because what the goals of that collective will be relative to the welfare of the individual parts is a massively open Question.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, no, it's really key. And the other nice thing about competency is that. So my central belief in all of this is that engineering is the right perspective on all of this stuff because it gets you away from subjective terms. People talk about sentience and this and that, those things very hard to define. People argue about them philosophically. I think that engineering terms like competency, like pursuit of goals, all of these things are empirically incredibly useful because you know it when you see it and if it helps you build. If I can pick the right level, I say this thing has, I believe this is X level of competency. I think it's like a thermostat, or I think it's like a better thermostat, or I think it's various other kinds of. There's many different kinds of complex systems. If that helps me to control and predict and build such systems, then that's all there is to say. There's no more philosophy to argue about. So I like competency in that way because you can quantify. In fact, you have to, you have to make a claim competent at what? And then. Or if I say, if I tell you it has a goal, the question is what's the goal? And how do you know? And I say, well, because every time I deviated from this particular state, that's what it spends energy to get back to. That's the goal. And we can quantify it and we can be objective about it. So we're not used to thinking about this. I give a talk sometimes called why don't robots get cancer? Right. And the reason robots don't get cancer is because, generally speaking, with a few exceptions, our architectures have been, you've got a bunch of dumb parts and you hope that if you put them together, the overlying machine will have some intelligence and do something or other. But the individual parts don't care. They don't have an agenda. Biology isn't like that. Every level has an agenda. And the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition both within and across levels. So, for example, during embryogenesis, your tissues and organs are competing with each other. And it's actually a really important part of development. There's a reason they compete with each other. They're not all just helping each other. They're also competing for information, for limited metabolic constraints. But to get back to your other point, which is this seems really efficient and good and so on compared to some of our human efforts. We also have to keep in mind that what happens here is that each level bends the option space for the level beneath, so that your parts, basically, they don't see the geometry. And I think I take this seriously. Terminology from relativity where the space is literally bent. So the option space is deformed by the higher level, so that. But the lower levels, all they really have to do is go down their concentration gradient. They don't have to. In fact, they don't. They can't know what the big picture is. But if you bend the space just right, if they do what locally seems right, they end up doing your bidding. They end up doing things that are optimal in the higher space. Conversely, because the components are good at getting their job done, you as the higher level, don't need to try to compute all the low level controls. All you're doing is bending the space. You don't know or care how they're going to do it. Give you a super simple example. In the tadpole, we found that, okay, so tadpoles need to become frogs. And to go from a tadpole head to a frog head, you have to rearrange the face. So the eyes have to move forward, the jaws have to come out, the nostrils move, like everything moves. It used to be thought that because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same, if you just remember, if every piece just moves in the right direction, the right amount, then you get your frog right. So we decided to test. I had this hypothesis that I thought actually the System's probably more intelligent than that. So what did we do? We made what we call Picasso tadpoles. So everything is scrambled. So the eyes are on the back of the head, the jaws are off to the side. Everything is scrambled. Well, guess what they make? They make pretty normal frogs because all the different things move around in novel paths, configurations, until they get to the correct froggy sort of frog face configuration. Then they stop. So the thing about that is, now imagine evolution. So you make some sort of mutation. And like every mutation, it does many things, so something good comes of it. But also it moves your mouth off to the side, right? Now, if there wasn't this multiscale competency, you can see where this is going. If there wasn't this multiscale competency, the organism would be dead. Your fitness is zero because you can't eat. And you would never get to explore the other beneficial consequences of that mutation. You'd have to wait until you find some other way of doing it without moving the mouth. That's really hard. So the fitness landscape would be incredibly rugged. Evolution would take forever. The reason it works, one of the reasons it works so well is because you do that, no worries, the mouth will find its way where it belongs, right? So now you get to explore. So what that means is that all of these mutations that otherwise would be deleterious are now neutral, because the competency of the parts make up for all kinds of things. So all the noise of development, all the variability in the environment, all these things, the competency of the parts makes up for it. So that's all fantastic, right? That's all great. The only other thing to remember when we compare this to human efforts is this. Every component has its own goals in various spaces, usually with very little regard for the welfare of the other levels. So as a simple example, you, as a complex system, you will go out and you will do jiu jitsu or whatever, you'll have some go. You have to go rock climbing and scrape a bunch of cells off your hands. And then you're happy as a system, you come back and you've accomplished some goals and you're really happy. Those cells are dead. They're gone. Right? Did you think about those cells? Not really. Right. You had some bruising al selfish sob. That's it. And so that's the thing to remember is that, and we know this from history, is that just being a collective isn't enough. Because what the goals of that collective will be relative to the welfare of the individual parts is a massively open Question.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, no, it's really key. And the other nice thing about competency is that. So my central belief in all of this is that engineering is the right perspective on all of this stuff because it gets you away from subjective terms. People talk about sentience and this and that, those things very hard to define. People argue about them philosophically. I think that engineering terms like competency, like pursuit of goals, all of these things are empirically incredibly useful because you know it when you see it and if it helps you build. If I can pick the right level, I say this thing has, I believe this is X level of competency. I think it's like a thermostat, or I think it's like a better thermostat, or I think it's various other kinds of. There's many different kinds of complex systems. If that helps me to control and predict and build such systems, then that's all there is to say. There's no more philosophy to argue about. So I like competency in that way because you can quantify. In fact, you have to, you have to make a claim competent at what? And then. Or if I say, if I tell you it has a goal, the question is what's the goal? And how do you know? And I say, well, because every time I deviated from this particular state, that's what it spends energy to get back to. That's the goal. And we can quantify it and we can be objective about it. So we're not used to thinking about this. I give a talk sometimes called why don't robots get cancer? Right. And the reason robots don't get cancer is because, generally speaking, with a few exceptions, our architectures have been, you've got a bunch of dumb parts and you hope that if you put them together, the overlying machine will have some intelligence and do something or other. But the individual parts don't care. They don't have an agenda. Biology isn't like that. Every level has an agenda. And the final outcome is the result of cooperation and competition both within and across levels. So, for example, during embryogenesis, your tissues and organs are competing with each other. And it's actually a really important part of development. There's a reason they compete with each other. They're not all just helping each other. They're also competing for information, for limited metabolic constraints. But to get back to your other point, which is this seems really efficient and good and so on compared to some of our human efforts. We also have to keep in mind that what happens here is that each level bends the option space for the level beneath, so that your parts, basically, they don't see the geometry. And I think I take this seriously. Terminology from relativity where the space is literally bent. So the option space is deformed by the higher level, so that. But the lower levels, all they really have to do is go down their concentration gradient. They don't have to. In fact, they don't. They can't know what the big picture is. But if you bend the space just right, if they do what locally seems right, they end up doing your bidding. They end up doing things that are optimal in the higher space. Conversely, because the components are good at getting their job done, you as the higher level, don't need to try to compute all the low level controls. All you're doing is bending the space. You don't know or care how they're going to do it. Give you a super simple example. In the tadpole, we found that, okay, so tadpoles need to become frogs. And to go from a tadpole head to a frog head, you have to rearrange the face. So the eyes have to move forward, the jaws have to come out, the nostrils move, like everything moves. It used to be thought that because all tadpoles look the same and all frogs look the same, if you just remember, if every piece just moves in the right direction, the right amount, then you get your frog right. So we decided to test. I had this hypothesis that I thought actually the System's probably more intelligent than that. So what did we do? We made what we call Picasso tadpoles. So everything is scrambled. So the eyes are on the back of the head, the jaws are off to the side. Everything is scrambled. Well, guess what they make? They make pretty normal frogs because all the different things move around in novel paths, configurations, until they get to the correct froggy sort of frog face configuration. Then they stop. So the thing about that is, now imagine evolution. So you make some sort of mutation. And like every mutation, it does many things, so something good comes of it. But also it moves your mouth off to the side, right? Now, if there wasn't this multiscale competency, you can see where this is going. If there wasn't this multiscale competency, the organism would be dead. Your fitness is zero because you can't eat. And you would never get to explore the other beneficial consequences of that mutation. You'd have to wait until you find some other way of doing it without moving the mouth. That's really hard. So the fitness landscape would be incredibly rugged. Evolution would take forever. The reason it works, one of the reasons it works so well is because you do that, no worries, the mouth will find its way where it belongs, right? So now you get to explore. So what that means is that all of these mutations that otherwise would be deleterious are now neutral, because the competency of the parts make up for all kinds of things. So all the noise of development, all the variability in the environment, all these things, the competency of the parts makes up for it. So that's all fantastic, right? That's all great. The only other thing to remember when we compare this to human efforts is this. Every component has its own goals in various spaces, usually with very little regard for the welfare of the other levels. So as a simple example, you, as a complex system, you will go out and you will do jiu jitsu or whatever, you'll have some go. You have to go rock climbing and scrape a bunch of cells off your hands. And then you're happy as a system, you come back and you've accomplished some goals and you're really happy. Those cells are dead. They're gone. Right? Did you think about those cells? Not really. Right. You had some bruising al selfish sob. That's it. And so that's the thing to remember is that, and we know this from history, is that just being a collective isn't enough. Because what the goals of that collective will be relative to the welfare of the individual parts is a massively open Question. Ends justify the means. I'm telling you, Stalin was onto something. No, so that's the danger. But we can. Exactly. That's the danger of. For us humans, we have to construct ethical systems under which we don't take seriously the full mechanism of biology and apply it to the way the world functions. Which is, which is an interesting line we've drawn. The world that built us is the one we reject in some sense, when we construct human societies. The idea that this country was founded on, that all men are created equal, that's such a fascinating idea. It's like you're fighting against nature and saying, well, there's something bigger here than a hierarchical competency architecture. But there's so many interesting things you said. So from an algorithmic perspective, the act of bending the option space, that's really, that's really profound. Because if you look at the way AI systems are built today, there's a big system, like I said with robots, and has a goal, and it gets better and better at optimizing that goal, at accomplishing that goal. But if biology built a hierarchical system where everything is doing computation and everything is accomplishing the goal, not only that, it's kind of dumb, you know, with the, with the limited, with a bent option space, it's just doing the thing that's the easiest thing for, in some sense. And somehow that allows you to have turtles on top of turtles. Literally dumb systems on top of dumb systems that as a whole create something incredibly smart.",

And somehow that allows you to have turtles on top of turtles. Literally dumb systems on top of dumb systems that as a whole create something incredibly smart. Yeah, I mean, every system has some degree of intelligence in its own problem domain. So cells will have problems they're trying to solve in physiological space and transcriptional space, and then I could give you some cool examples of that. But the collective is trying to solve problems in anatomical space and forming a creature and growing your blood vessels and so on. And then the whole body is solving yet other problems. They may be in social space and linguist space and three dimensional space, and who knows, the group might be solving problems in, I don't know, some sort of financial space or something. So one of the major differences with most AIs today is a, the kind of flatness of the architecture, but also of the fact that they're constructed from outside their borders and their, you know, so, so if you. So to a large extent, and of course there are counterexamples now, but, but to a large extent, our technology had been such that you create a machine or a robot, it knows what its sensors are, it knows what its effectors are, it knows the boundary between it and the outside World. All of this is given from the outside. Biology constructs this from scratch. Now the best example of this that, that originally in, in robotics was actually Josh Bongard's work in 2006 where he made these, these robots that did not know their shape to start with. So like a baby, they sort of floundered around, they made some hypotheses. Well, I did this and I moved in this way. Well, maybe I'm a whatever, maybe I have wheels or maybe I have six legs or whatever, right? And they would make a model and then eventually it would crawl around. So that's, I mean that's really good. That's part of the autopoiesis. But we can go a step further and some people are doing this and then we're sort of working on some of this too. Is this idea that, let's even go back further. You don't even know what sensors you have. You don't know where you end and the outside world begins. All you have is certain things like active inference, meaning you're trying to minimize surprise, right? You have some metabolic constraints. You don't have all the energy you need. You don't have all the time in the world to think about everything you want to think about. So that means that you can't afford to be a micro reductionist. All this data coming in, you have to coarse grain and say, I'm going to take all this stuff and I'm going to call that a cat. I'm going to take all this, I'm going to call that the edge of the table. I don't want to fall off of and I don't want to know anything about the microstates. What I want to know is what is the optimal way to cut up my world. And by the way, this thing over here, that's me. The reason that's me is because I have more control over this than I have over any of this other stuff. Stuff. And so now you can begin to. So that self construction, that figuring out, making models of the outside world and then turning that inwards and starting to make a model of yourself, which immediately starts to get into issues of agency and control. Because in order to, if you are under metabolic constraints, meaning you don't have the energy, right. That all the energy in the world, you have to be efficient. That immediately forces you to start telling stories about coarse grained agents that do things. You don't have the energy to Laplace's demon calculate every, every possible state that's going to happen. You have to coarse Grain. And you have to say, that is the kind of creature that does things, either things that I avoid or things that I will go towards, that's a mate or food or whatever it's going to be. And so right at the base of simple, very simple organisms, starting to make models of agents doing things. That is the origin of models of free will, basically, because you see the world around you as having agency and then you turn that on yourself and you say, wait, I have agency too. I do things. Right. And then you make decisions about what you're going to do. So all of this one model is to view all of those kinds of things as being driven by that early need to determine what you are and to do so and to then take actions in the most energetically efficient space possible.",

So all of this one model is to view all of those kinds of things as being driven by that early need to determine what you are and to do so and to then take actions in the most energetically efficient space possible. So free will emerges when you try to simplify, tell a nice narrative about your environment. I think that's very plausible. Yeah, you think free will is an illusion, so you're kind of implying that it's a useful hack. Well, I'll say two things. The first thing is I think it's very plausible to say that any organism that's self or any agent that's self, whether it's biological or not, any agent that self constructs under energy constraints is going to believe in free will. We'll get to whether it has free will momentarily. But I think what it definitely drives is a view of yourself and the outside world as an agent. I think that's inescapable. So that's true for even primitive organisms? I think so. I think that's now. Now they don't have. Now obviously you have to scale down. Right. So they don't have the kinds of complex metacognition that we have. So they can do long term planning and thinking about free will and so and so on. But the sense of agency is really useful to accomplish tasks simple or complicated. That's right. In all kinds of spaces, not just in obvious three dimensional space. I mean we're very good that the thing is, is humans are very good at detecting agency of medium sized objects moving at medium speeds. In the three dimensional world. Right. We see a bowling ball and we see a mouse and we immediately know what the difference is. Right. And how we're going to mostly things you can eat or get eaten by. Yeah, yeah. That's our training set. Right. From the time you're little, your training set is visual data on this little chunk of your experience. But imagine if from the time that we were born, we had innate senses of your blood chemistry. If you could feel your blood chemistry, the way you can see, right. You had a high bandwidth connection and you could feel your blood chemistry and you could see, you could sense all the things that your organs were doing.

We do have access to that information. So it's actually possible that, so evolution could, if we wanted to construct an organism that's able to perceive the flow of blood through your body the way you see an old friend and say, yo, what's up? How's the wife and the kids? In that same way you would see, you feel like a connection to the liver. Yeah, yeah, I think, you know, maybe other people's liver. No, just your own. Because you don't have access to other people's. Not yet. But you could imagine some really interesting connection. Right, but like sexual selection, like, oh, that girl's got a nice liver. Well, that's like the, the way her, her blood flows, the, the dynamics of the blood is very interesting. It's novel. I've never seen one of those. But you know, that's, that's exactly what we're trying to half ass when we, when we judge judgment of beauty by facial symmetry, that's, that's a half assed assessment of exactly that. Of exactly that. Because if your cells could not cooperate enough to keep your, your organism symmetrical. Yeah. You know, you can make some inferences about what else is wrong. Right. Like that's a, that's a very, you know, that's a very basic, interesting. Yeah. So that in some deep sense, actually that is what we're doing. We're trying to infer how the health. We use the word healthy, but basically how functional is this biological system looking at so I can hook up with that one and make offspring. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what kind of hardware might their genomics give me that might be useful in the future? I wonder why evolution didn't give us higher resolution signal. Like why the whole peacock thing with the feathers, it doesn't seem, it's a very low bandwidth signal. For sexual selection. I'm gonna, and I'm not an expert on this stuff, but on peacocks? Well, no, you know, but, but I'll take a stab at the reason. I, I think that it's because it's an arms race. You see, you don't want everybody to know everything about you. So I think that as much as, and in fact there's another interesting part of this arms race which is if you think about this, the most adaptive evolvable system is one that has the most level of top down control. If it's really easy to say to a bunch of cells, make another finger versus okay, here's 10,000 gene expression changes that you need to do to make to change your finger. Right. The, with good top down control that has memory. And we need to get back to that, by the way. That's a question I neglected to answer about where the memory is and so on. A system that uses all of that is really highly evolvable and that's fantastic. But guess what? It's also highly subject to hijacking by parasites, by cheaters of various kinds, by conspecifics. We found that. And then that goes back to the story of the pattern memory in these planaria. There's a bacterium that lives on these planaria. That bacterium has an input into how many heads the worm is going to have because it hijacks that, that control system and it's able to make a chemical that basically interfaces with the system, that calculates how many heads you're supposed to have. And they can have two, and they can make them have two heads. And so you can imagine that if you are too. So you want to be understandable for your own parts to understand each other, but you don't want to be too understandable because you'll be too easily controllable. And so I think that, my guess is that the, that that opposing pressure keeps this from being a super high bandwidth kind of thing where we could just look at somebody and know, know everything about them.",

Like that's a, that's a very, you know, that's a very basic, interesting. Yeah. So that in some deep sense, actually that is what we're doing. We're trying to infer how the health. We use the word healthy, but basically how functional is this biological system looking at so I can hook up with that one and make offspring. Yeah. Yeah. Well, what kind of hardware might their genomics give me that might be useful in the future? I wonder why evolution didn't give us higher resolution signal. Like why the whole peacock thing with the feathers, it doesn't seem, it's a very low bandwidth signal. For sexual selection. I'm gonna, and I'm not an expert on this stuff, but on peacocks? Well, no, you know, but, but I'll take a stab at the reason. I, I think that it's because it's an arms race. You see, you don't want everybody to know everything about you. So I think that as much as, and in fact there's another interesting part of this arms race which is if you think about this, the most adaptive evolvable system is one that has the most level of top down control. If it's really easy to say to a bunch of cells, make another finger versus okay, here's 10,000 gene expression changes that you need to do to make to change your finger. Right. The, with good top down control that has memory. And we need to get back to that, by the way. That's a question I neglected to answer about where the memory is and so on. A system that uses all of that is really highly evolvable and that's fantastic. But guess what? It's also highly subject to hijacking by parasites, by cheaters of various kinds, by conspecifics. We found that. And then that goes back to the story of the pattern memory in these planaria. There's a bacterium that lives on these planaria. That bacterium has an input into how many heads the worm is going to have because it hijacks that, that control system and it's able to make a chemical that basically interfaces with the system, that calculates how many heads you're supposed to have. And they can have two, and they can make them have two heads. And so you can imagine that if you are too. So you want to be understandable for your own parts to understand each other, but you don't want to be too understandable because you'll be too easily controllable. And so I think that, my guess is that the, that that opposing pressure keeps this from being a super high bandwidth kind of thing where we could just look at somebody and know, know everything about them. So it's a kind of biological game of Texas hold'. Em. Yeah, you're showing some cards and you're hiding other cards and that's part of it. And there's bluffing and there's, and all that and then there's probably whole species that would do way too much bluffing. That's probably where peacocks fall. I, there's a, there's a book that I don't remember if I read or if I, if I wrote if I read summaries of the book, but it's about evolution of beauty and birds. Where's that from? Is that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk about it? But basically there's some species started to like over select for beauty. Not over select, they just some reason select for beauty. There is a case to be made, actually. Now I'm starting to remember. I think Darwin himself made a case that you can select based on beauty alone. So yeah, that beauty. There's a point where B doesn't represent some underlying biological truth. You start to select for, for beauty itself. And I think the, the deep question is there is some, is there some evolutionary value to beauty? But it's an interesting kind of thought that this. Can we deviate completely from the deep biological truth to actually appreciate some kind of the, the summarization in itself? Let me get back to memory because this is a really interesting idea. How do a collection of cells remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine?",

How do a collection of cells remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine? Yeah. One of the ways to start thinking about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves, where did neurons and all these cool tricks that the brain uses to run these amazing problem solving abilities on basically an electrical network? Where did that come from? They didn't just evolve, appear out of nowhere. It must have evolved from something. And what it evolved from was a much more ancient ability of cells to form networks, to solve other kinds of problems, for example, to navigate morphospace, to control the body shape, shape. And so all of the components of neurons, so ion channels, neurotransmitter machinery, electrical synapses, all this stuff is way older than brains, way older than neurons, in fact older than multicellularity. And so it was already even bacterial biofilms. There's some beautiful work from UCSD on brain like dynamics and bacterial biofilms. So evolution figured out very early on that electrical networks are amazing at having memories, at integrating information across distance at different kinds of optimization tasks, image recognition and so on, long before there were brains.",

And there's bluffing and there's, and all that and then there's probably whole species that would do way too much bluffing. That's probably where peacocks fall. I, there's a, there's a book that I don't remember if I read or if I, if I wrote if I read summaries of the book, but it's about evolution of beauty and birds. Where's that from? Is that a book or does Richard Dawkins talk about it? But basically there's some species started to like over select for beauty. Not over select, they just some reason select for beauty. There is a case to be made, actually. Now I'm starting to remember. I think Darwin himself made a case that you can select based on beauty alone. So yeah, that beauty. There's a point where B doesn't represent some underlying biological truth. You start to select for, for beauty itself. And I think the, the deep question is there is some, is there some evolutionary value to beauty? But it's an interesting kind of thought that this. Can we deviate completely from the deep biological truth to actually appreciate some kind of the, the summarization in itself? Let me get back to memory because this is a really interesting idea. How do a collection of cells remember anything? How do biological systems remember anything? How is that akin to the kind of memory we think of humans as having within our big cognitive engine? Yeah. One of the ways to start thinking about bioelectricity is to ask ourselves, where did neurons and all these cool tricks that the brain uses to run these amazing problem solving abilities on basically an electrical network? Where did that come from? They didn't just evolve, appear out of nowhere. It must have evolved from something. And what it evolved from was a much more ancient ability of cells to form networks, to solve other kinds of problems, for example, to navigate morphospace, to control the body shape, shape. And so all of the components of neurons, so ion channels, neurotransmitter machinery, electrical synapses, all this stuff is way older than brains, way older than neurons, in fact older than multicellularity. And so it was already even bacterial biofilms. There's some beautiful work from UCSD on brain like dynamics and bacterial biofilms. So evolution figured out very early on that electrical networks are amazing at having memories, at integrating information across distance at different kinds of optimization tasks, image recognition and so on, long before there were brains. Can you actually step back? We'll return to it. What is bioelectricity? What is biochemistry? What are electrical networks? I think a lot of the biology community focuses on the chemicals as the signaling mechanisms that make the whole thing work. You have, I think to a large degree, uniquely, maybe you can correct me on that. Have focused on the bioelectricity, which is using electricity for signaling. There's also probably mechanical. Sure, sure. Knocking on the door. So what's the difference? And what's an electrical network. Yeah. So I want to make sure and kind of give credit where credit is due. So as far back as 1903 and probably late 1800s already, people were thinking about the importance of electrical phenomena in life. So I'm for sure not the first person to stress the importance of electricity. There were waves of research in the 30s, in the 40s, and then again in the kind of 70s, 80s and 90s of sort of the pioneers of bioelectricity who did some amazing work on all this. I think what we've done that's new is to step away from this idea that. That. And I'll describe what the bioelectricity is, is step away from the idea that, well, here's another piece of physics that you need to keep track of to understand physiology and development and to really start looking at this as saying, no, this is a privileged computational layer that gives you access to the actual cognition of the tissue of basal cognition. So merging that developmental biophysics with ideas and cognition of computation and so on, I think that's what we've done. That's new. But people have been talking about bioelectricity for a really long time, and so I'll define that. So. So what happens is that if you have a single cell, cell has a membrane. In that membrane are proteins called ion channels. And those proteins allow charged molecules, potassium, sodium, chloride, to go in and out under certain circumstances. And when there's an imbalance of those ions, there becomes a voltage gradient across that membrane. And so all cells, all living cells, try to hold a particular kind of. Of voltage difference across the membrane. And they spend a lot of energy to do so. When you now. So that's a single cell. When you have multiple cells, the cells sitting next to each other, they can communicate their voltage state to each other via a number of different ways. But one of them is this thing called a gap junction, which is basically like a little submarine hatch that just kind of docks. Right. And the ions from one side can flow to the other side and vice versa.",

And the ions from one side can flow to the other side and vice versa. Isn't it incredible that this evolves? Isn't that wild? Because that didn't exist. Correct. This had to be evolved and it. Had to be invented. That's right. So somebody invented electricity in the ocean. When did this get invented? Yeah, it is incredible. The guy who discovered gap junctions, Werner Lowenstein, I visited him. He was really old human being. He discovered them because who really discovered them lived probably 4 billion years ago. Good point. So you give credit where credit is due. I'm just saying he Redistributed, rediscovered gap junctions. But when I visited him in woods hole, maybe 20 years ago now, he told me that he was writing and unfortunately he passed away. And I think this book never got written. He was writing a book on gap junctions in consciousness. And I think it would have been an incredible book because gap junctions are magic. I'll explain why in a minute. What happens is that just imagine the thing about both these ion channels and these gap junctions is that many of them are themselves voltage sensitive. So that's a voltage sensitive current conductance, that's a transistor. And as soon as you've invented one, immediately you now get access to, from this platonic space of mathematical truths, you get access to all of the cool things that transistors do. So now, when you have a network of cells, not only do they talk to each other, but they can send messages to each other and the differences of voltage can propagate. Now, to neuroscientists, this is old hat because you see this in the brain, right? This action potential is the electricity. They have these awesome movies where you can take a transparent animal, like a zebrafish, you can literally look down and you can see all the firings as the fish is making decisions about what to eat and things like this. It's amazing. Well, your whole body is doing that all the time, just much slower. So there are very few things that neurons do that other cells that all the cells in your body don't do. They all do very similar things just on a much slower timescale. And whereas your brain is thinking about how to solve problems in three dimensional space space, the cells in an embryo are thinking about how to solve problems in anatomical space. They're trying to have memories like, hey, how many fingers are we supposed to have? Well, how many do we have now? What do we do to get from here to there? That's the kind of problems they're thinking about. And the reason that gap junctions are magic is imagine right from the earliest time, here are two cells, this cell. How can they communicate? Well, the simple version is, is this cell could send a chemical signal. It floats over and it hits a receptor on this cell, right? Because it comes from outside, this cell can very easily tell that that came from outside. Whatever information is coming, that's not my information, that information is coming from the outside. So I can trust it, I can ignore it, I can do various things with it, whatever, but I know it comes from the outside. Now imagine instead that you have two cells with a gap junction between them. Something Happens, let's say the cell gets poked, there's a calcium spike. Spike, the calcium spike or whatever small molecule signal propagates through the gap junction to this cell. There's no ownership metadata on that signal. This cell does not know now that it's didn't that it came from outside because it looks exactly like its own memories would have looked like of being, of being, of whatever had happened. Right.

      "transcript_text": "Yeah. So I want to make sure and kind of give credit where credit is due. So as far back as 1903 and probably late 1800s already, people were thinking about the importance of electrical phenomena in life. So I'm for sure not the first person to stress the importance of electricity. There were waves of research in the 30s, in the 40s, and then again in the kind of 70s, 80s and 90s of sort of the pioneers of bioelectricity who did some amazing work on all this. I think what we've done that's new is to step away from this idea that. That. And I'll describe what the bioelectricity is, is step away from the idea that, well, here's another piece of physics that you need to keep track of to understand physiology and development and to really start looking at this as saying, no, this is a privileged computational layer that gives you access to the actual cognition of the tissue of basal cognition. So merging that developmental biophysics with ideas and cognition of computation and so on, I think that's what we've done. That's new. But people have been talking about bioelectricity for a really long time, and so I'll define that. So. So what happens is that if you have a single cell, cell has a membrane. In that membrane are proteins called ion channels. And those proteins allow charged molecules, potassium, sodium, chloride, to go in and out under certain circumstances. And when there's an imbalance of those ions, there becomes a voltage gradient across that membrane. And so all cells, all living cells, try to hold a particular kind of. Of voltage difference across the membrane. And they spend a lot of energy to do so. When you now. So that's a single cell. When you have multiple cells, the cells sitting next to each other, they can communicate their voltage state to each other via a number of different ways. But one of them is this thing called a gap junction, which is basically like a little submarine hatch that just kind of docks. Right. And the ions from one side can flow to the other side and vice versa. Isn't it incredible that this evolves? Isn't that wild? Because that didn't exist. Correct. This had to be evolved and it. Had to be invented. That's right. So somebody invented electricity in the ocean. When did this get invented? Yeah, it is incredible. The guy who discovered gap junctions, Werner Lowenstein, I visited him. He was really old human being. He discovered them because who really discovered them lived probably 4 billion years ago. Good point. So you give credit where credit is due. I'm just saying he Redistributed, rediscovered gap junctions. But when I visited him in woods hole, maybe 20 years ago now, he told me that he was writing and unfortunately he passed away. And I think this book never got written. He was writing a book on gap junctions in consciousness. And I think it would have been an incredible book because gap junctions are magic. I'll explain why in a minute. What happens is that just imagine the thing about both these ion channels and these gap junctions is that many of them are themselves voltage sensitive. So that's a voltage sensitive current conductance, that's a transistor. And as soon as you've invented one, immediately you now get access to, from this platonic space of mathematical truths, you get access to all of the cool things that transistors do. So now, when you have a network of cells, not only do they talk to each other, but they can send messages to each other and the differences of voltage can propagate. Now, to neuroscientists, this is old hat because you see this in the brain, right? This action potential is the electricity. They have these awesome movies where you can take a transparent animal, like a zebrafish, you can literally look down and you can see all the firings as the fish is making decisions about what to eat and things like this. It's amazing. Well, your whole body is doing that all the time, just much slower. So there are very few things that neurons do that other cells that all the cells in your body don't do. They all do very similar things just on a much slower timescale. And whereas your brain is thinking about how to solve problems in three dimensional space space, the cells in an embryo are thinking about how to solve problems in anatomical space. They're trying to have memories like, hey, how many fingers are we supposed to have? Well, how many do we have now? What do we do to get from here to there? That's the kind of problems they're thinking about. And the reason that gap junctions are magic is imagine right from the earliest time, here are two cells, this cell. How can they communicate? Well, the simple version is, is this cell could send a chemical signal. It floats over and it hits a receptor on this cell, right? Because it comes from outside, this cell can very easily tell that that came from outside. Whatever information is coming, that's not my information, that information is coming from the outside. So I can trust it, I can ignore it, I can do various things with it, whatever, but I know it comes from the outside. Now imagine instead that you have two cells with a gap junction between them. Something Happens, let's say the cell gets poked, there's a calcium spike. Spike, the calcium spike or whatever small molecule signal propagates through the gap junction to this cell. There's no ownership metadata on that signal. This cell does not know now that it's didn't that it came from outside because it looks exactly like its own memories would have looked like of being, of being, of whatever had happened. Right. So gap junctions to some extent wipe ownership information on data. Which means that if I can't, if you and I are sharing memories and we can't quite tell who the memories belong to, that's the beginning of a mind melt. That's the beginning of a scale up of cognition from here's me and here's you to no, now there's just us.",

      "transcript_text": "I'm just saying he Redistributed, rediscovered gap junctions. But when I visited him in woods hole, maybe 20 years ago now, he told me that he was writing and unfortunately he passed away. And I think this book never got written. He was writing a book on gap junctions in consciousness. And I think it would have been an incredible book because gap junctions are magic. I'll explain why in a minute. What happens is that just imagine the thing about both these ion channels and these gap junctions is that many of them are themselves voltage sensitive. So that's a voltage sensitive current conductance, that's a transistor. And as soon as you've invented one, immediately you now get access to, from this platonic space of mathematical truths, you get access to all of the cool things that transistors do. So now, when you have a network of cells, not only do they talk to each other, but they can send messages to each other and the differences of voltage can propagate. Now, to neuroscientists, this is old hat because you see this in the brain, right? This action potential is the electricity. They have these awesome movies where you can take a transparent animal, like a zebrafish, you can literally look down and you can see all the firings as the fish is making decisions about what to eat and things like this. It's amazing. Well, your whole body is doing that all the time, just much slower. So there are very few things that neurons do that other cells that all the cells in your body don't do. They all do very similar things just on a much slower timescale. And whereas your brain is thinking about how to solve problems in three dimensional space space, the cells in an embryo are thinking about how to solve problems in anatomical space. They're trying to have memories like, hey, how many fingers are we supposed to have? Well, how many do we have now? What do we do to get from here to there? That's the kind of problems they're thinking about. And the reason that gap junctions are magic is imagine right from the earliest time, here are two cells, this cell. How can they communicate? Well, the simple version is, is this cell could send a chemical signal. It floats over and it hits a receptor on this cell, right? Because it comes from outside, this cell can very easily tell that that came from outside. Whatever information is coming, that's not my information, that information is coming from the outside. So I can trust it, I can ignore it, I can do various things with it, whatever, but I know it comes from the outside. Now imagine instead that you have two cells with a gap junction between them. Something Happens, let's say the cell gets poked, there's a calcium spike. Spike, the calcium spike or whatever small molecule signal propagates through the gap junction to this cell. There's no ownership metadata on that signal. This cell does not know now that it's didn't that it came from outside because it looks exactly like its own memories would have looked like of being, of being, of whatever had happened. Right. So gap junctions to some extent wipe ownership information on data. Which means that if I can't, if you and I are sharing memories and we can't quite tell who the memories belong to, that's the beginning of a mind melt. That's the beginning of a scale up of cognition from here's me and here's you to no, now there's just us. So they enforce a collective intelligence. That's our gap junctions. That's right. It helps. It's the beginning. It's not the whole story by any means, but it's the start. Where's state stored of the system? Is it in part in the gap junctions themselves? Is it in the cells? There are many, many layers to this, as always in biology. So there are chemical networks, so for example gene regulatory networks or basically any kind of chemical pathway where different chemicals activate and repress each other. They can store memories. So in a dynamical system sense, they can store memories. They can get into stable states that are hard to pull them out of. That becomes once they get in, that's a memory, a permanent memory or a semi permanent memory of something that's happened. There are cytoskeletal structures that are physically, they store memories in physical configuration. There are electrical memory like flip flops where there is no physical. Right. So if you look, I show my students, this example is a flip flop. And the reason that it stores a 0 or 1 is not because some piece of the hardware moved. It's because there's a cycling of the current in one side of the thing. If I come over and I hold the other side to a high voltage for a brief period of time, it flips over and now it's here, here, but the hard, none of the hardware moved. The information is in a stable dynamical sense. And if you were to X ray the thing, you couldn't tell me if it was 0 or 1 because all you would see is where the hardware is. You wouldn't see the energetic state of the system. So there are also. So there are bioelectrical states that are held in that exact way, like volatile ram, basically in the electrical state it's.",

Very akin to the different ways the memory stored in a computer. So there's ram, there's hard drives, you. Can make that mapping. Right. So I think the interesting thing is that based on the biology we can have a more sophisticated. I think we can revise some of our computer engineering methods because there are some interesting things that biology does we haven't done yet. But that mapping is not bad. I mean, I think it works in many ways. Yeah, I wonder because I mean, the way we build computers at the root of computer science is the idea of proof of correctness, the way we program things to be perfect, reliable. You know, this idea of resilience and robustness to unknown conditions is not as important. So that's what biology is really good at. So I don't know what kind of systems, I don't know how we go from a computer to a biological system in the future. Yeah, I think that, you know, you know, the thing about biology, like is, is all about, about making really important decisions really quickly on very limited information. I mean, that's what biology is all about. You have to act, you have to act now. The stakes are very high and you don't know most of what you need to know to be perfect. And so there's not even an attempt to be perfect or to get it right in any sense. There are just things like active inference, minimize surprise, optimize some efficiency, and some things like this that guides the whole business. I mentioned too offline, that somebody who's a fan of your work is Andre Kapathy and he's amongst many things, also writes occasionally a great blog. He came up with this idea, I don't know if he coined the term, but of software 2.0, where the programming is done in the space of configuring these artificial neural networks. Is there some sense in which that would be the future of programming for us humans where we're less doing like Python, like programming and more, how would that look like. But basically doing the hyperparameters of something akin to a biological system and watching it go and keeping adjusting it and creating some kind of feedback loop within the system so it corrects itself and then we watch it over time accomplish the goals we want it to accomplish. Is that kind of the, the dream of the, the dogs that you describe in the Nature paper?",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, I wonder because I mean, the way we build computers at the root of computer science is the idea of proof of correctness, the way we program things to be perfect, reliable. You know, this idea of resilience and robustness to unknown conditions is not as important. So that's what biology is really good at. So I don't know what kind of systems, I don't know how we go from a computer to a biological system in the future. Yeah, I think that, you know, you know, the thing about biology, like is, is all about, about making really important decisions really quickly on very limited information. I mean, that's what biology is all about. You have to act, you have to act now. The stakes are very high and you don't know most of what you need to know to be perfect. And so there's not even an attempt to be perfect or to get it right in any sense. There are just things like active inference, minimize surprise, optimize some efficiency, and some things like this that guides the whole business. I mentioned too offline, that somebody who's a fan of your work is Andre Kapathy and he's amongst many things, also writes occasionally a great blog. He came up with this idea, I don't know if he coined the term, but of software 2.0, where the programming is done in the space of configuring these artificial neural networks. Is there some sense in which that would be the future of programming for us humans where we're less doing like Python, like programming and more, how would that look like. But basically doing the hyperparameters of something akin to a biological system and watching it go and keeping adjusting it and creating some kind of feedback loop within the system so it corrects itself and then we watch it over time accomplish the goals we want it to accomplish. Is that kind of the, the dream of the, the dogs that you describe in the Nature paper? Yeah, yeah. I mean that, that's what you just painted is, is a very good description of our efforts at regenerative medicine as a kind of somatic psychiatry. So the idea is that you're not you know, you're not trying to micromanage. I mean, think, think about the limitations of, of a lot of the medicines today. We try to interact down at the level of pathways, right? So we're trying to micromanage it. What's the problem? Well, one problem is that for almost every medicine other than antibiotics, once you stop it, the problem comes right back. You haven't fixed anything. You were addressing symptoms, you weren't actually curing anything again, except for antibiotics. That's one problem. The other problem is you have massive amount of side effects because you were trying to interact at the lowest level. It's like, I'm going to try to program this computer by changing the melting point of copper. Maybe you can do things that way, but my God, it's hard to program at the hardware level. So what I think we're starting to understand is that, and by the way, this goes back to what you were saying before about that we could have access to our internal state. So people who practice that kind of stuff, so yoga and biofeedback and those, those are all the people that uniformly will say things like, well, the body has an intelligence and this, like those two sets overlap perfectly. Because, because that's exactly right. Because once you, once you start thinking about it that way, you realize that the better locus of control is not always at the lowest level. This is why we don't all program with a soldering iron, right? We take advantage of the high level intelligences that are there, which means trying to figure out, okay, which of your tissues can learn, what can they learn? Why is it that certain drugs stop working after you take them for a while? With its habituation, right? And so can we understand habituation, sensitization, associative learning, these kinds of things in chemical pathways, we're going to have a completely different way, I think we're going to have a completely different way of using drugs and of medicine in general when we start focusing on the goal states and on the intelligence of our subsystems as opposed to, to treating everything as if the only path was micromanagement from chemistry upwards.",

Well, can you speak to this idea of somatic psychiatry? What are somatic cells? How do they form networks that use bioelectricity to have memory and all those kinds of things. Yeah. What are somatic cells like? Basics here. Somatic cells just means the cells of your body. Soma just means body, right? So, so somatic cells are just this. I'm not even specifically making a distinction between somatics and cells and stem cells or Anything like that. I mean, basically, all the cells in your body, not just neurons, but all the cells in your body, they form electrical networks during embryogenesis, during regeneration. What those networks are doing in part is processing information about what our current shape is and what the goal shape is. Now, how do I know this? Because I can give you a couple of examples. One example is when we started studying this, we said, okay, here's a planarian. A planarian is a flatworm. It has one head and one tail, normally. And there's several amazing things about planaria, but basically, I think planaria hold the answer to pretty much every deep question of life. For one thing, they're similar to our ancestors. So they have true symmetry, they have a true brain. They're not like earthworms. They're much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they're these little. They're about maybe 2 centimeters in the centimeter to 2 in size. They have a head and a tail. The first thing is planaria are immortal, fertile, so they do not age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that. Well, over time, everything degrades. No planaria can keep it going for probably. How long have they been around 400 million years. Right. So these are the actual. So the planaria in our lab are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, can you speak to this idea of somatic psychiatry? What are somatic cells? How do they form networks that use bioelectricity to have memory and all those kinds of things. Yeah. What are somatic cells like? Basics here. Somatic cells just means the cells of your body. Soma just means body, right? So, so somatic cells are just this. I'm not even specifically making a distinction between somatics and cells and stem cells or Anything like that. I mean, basically, all the cells in your body, not just neurons, but all the cells in your body, they form electrical networks during embryogenesis, during regeneration. What those networks are doing in part is processing information about what our current shape is and what the goal shape is. Now, how do I know this? Because I can give you a couple of examples. One example is when we started studying this, we said, okay, here's a planarian. A planarian is a flatworm. It has one head and one tail, normally. And there's several amazing things about planaria, but basically, I think planaria hold the answer to pretty much every deep question of life. For one thing, they're similar to our ancestors. So they have true symmetry, they have a true brain. They're not like earthworms. They're much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they're these little. They're about maybe 2 centimeters in the centimeter to 2 in size. They have a head and a tail. The first thing is planaria are immortal, fertile, so they do not age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that. Well, over time, everything degrades. No planaria can keep it going for probably. How long have they been around 400 million years. Right. So these are the actual. So the planaria in our lab are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago. So there's planaria that have lived that long. Long, essentially. What does it mean, physical continuity? Because. Because what they do is they split in half. The way they reproduce is they split in half. So. So the planarian, the back. The back end grabs the petri dish, the front end takes off and they. They rip themselves in half. But is. Isn't. In some sense, we're like. You are a physical continuation. Yes. Except that. Except that we go through a bottleneck of one cell, which is the egg. They do not. I mean, they can. There are certain. Planaria. Got it. So we go through a very ruthless compression process, and they don't. Yes. Like. Or sort of squash down to one cell and then back out. These guys just tear themselves in half. And so the other amazing thing about them is they regenerate so you can cut them into pieces. The record is, I think, 276 or something like that by Thomas Hunt Morgan. And each piece regrows a perfect little worm. They know exactly. Every piece knows exactly what's missing. What needs to happen. In fact, if you chop it in half, as it grows, the other half, the original. The original tissue shrinks so that when the new tiny head shows up, they're proportional. So it keeps. It keeps perfect proportion. If you. If you starve them, they shrink. If you feed them again, they expand. They. Their control. Their anatomical control is. Is. Is just insane. Somebody cut them into over 200 pieces. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thomas Hunt Morgan did.",

I bet he lost some due to infection. I bet. I bet it's actually more than that. You could. I bet you could do more than that. Humans can't do that. Well, yes. I mean, again, true. Except maybe you can at the embryonic level. Well, that's the thing, right. So I tell. When I talk about this, I said, just remember that as amazing as it is to grow a whole planarian from a tiny fragment, half of the human population can grow a full body from one cell. Right. So development is really. You can look at development as just an example of regeneration generation. Yeah. To think we'll talk about regenerative medicine. But there's some sense what would be like that warm in like 500 years where I can just go regrow a hand. Yep. With given time. It takes time to grow large things. But for now. Yeah, I think so. I think you can probably. Why not accelerate. Oh, biology takes its time. I'm not going to say anything is impossible, but I don't know of a way to accelerate these processes. I think it's possible. I think we are going to be regenerative narrative. But I don't know of a way to make it fast. I could just think people from a few centuries from now be like, well, they have to. They used to have to wait a week for the hand to regrow. It's like when the microwave was invented. You can. You can toast your. What's that called? When you put a cheese on a toast, it's delicious. Is all. I know. I'm blinking. And you and you. All right, so planaria. Why were we talking about the magical planaria? That they have the mystery of life. Yeah. So the reason we're talking about planaria is not only are they immortal, not only do they regenerate every part of the body, they generally don't get cancer. Right. So which we can talk about why that's important. They're smart, they can learn things. So you can train them. And it turns out that if you train a planarian and then cut their heads off, the tail will regenerate a brand new brain that still remembers the original information. Do they have a bioelectrical network going on or no? Yes. So their somatic cells are forming a network. And that's, that's what you mean by a true brain. What's the requirement for a true brain?",

      "transcript_text": "I'm not going to say anything is impossible, but I don't know of a way to accelerate these processes. I think it's possible. I think we are going to be regenerative narrative. But I don't know of a way to make it fast. I could just think people from a few centuries from now be like, well, they have to. They used to have to wait a week for the hand to regrow. It's like when the microwave was invented. You can. You can toast your. What's that called? When you put a cheese on a toast, it's delicious. Is all. I know. I'm blinking. And you and you. All right, so planaria. Why were we talking about the magical planaria? That they have the mystery of life. Yeah. So the reason we're talking about planaria is not only are they immortal, not only do they regenerate every part of the body, they generally don't get cancer. Right. So which we can talk about why that's important. They're smart, they can learn things. So you can train them. And it turns out that if you train a planarian and then cut their heads off, the tail will regenerate a brand new brain that still remembers the original information. Do they have a bioelectrical network going on or no? Yes. So their somatic cells are forming a network. And that's, that's what you mean by a true brain. What's the requirement for a true brain? Like everything else, it's a continuum. But, but, but a true brain has certain characteristics as far as the density, like a localized density of neurons that. Guides behavior in the head. Exactly. Connected to the head. Exactly. If you cut their head off, the tail doesn't have. That doesn't do anything. It just sits there until the new brain is. Until a new brain regenerates. They have all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have, but here's why we're talking about them in this context. So here's your planaria. You cut off the head, you cut off the tail. You have a middle fragment. That middle fragment has to make one head and one tail. How does it know how many of each to make and where do they go? How come it doesn't switch? How come? Right. So we did a very simple thing and we said, okay, let's make the hypothesis that, that there's a somatic electrical network that remembers the correct pattern and that what it's doing is recalling that memory and building to that pattern. So what we did was we used a way to visualize electrical activity in these cells. It's a variant of what people use to look for electricity in the brain. And we saw that that fragment has a very particular electrical pattern. You can literally see it. Once we developed the technique, it has a very particular electrical pattern pattern that shows you where the head and the tail goes. Right? You can, you can just see it. And then we said, okay, well now let's test the idea that that's a memory that actually controls where the head and the tail goes. Let's change that pattern. So basically incept a false memory. And so what you can do is you can do that in many different ways. One way is with drugs that target ion channels to say. And so you pick these drugs and you say, okay, I'm going to do it. So that instead of this one head, one tail electrical pattern, you have a two headed pattern. You're just editing the electrical information in the network. When you do that, guess what the cells build. They build a two headed worm. And the coolest thing about it now, no genetic changes. So we haven't touched the genome. The genome is Totally wild type. But the amazing thing about it is that when you take these two headed animals and you cut them into pieces again, some of those pieces will continue to make two headed animals. So that information, that memory, that electrical circuit, not only does it hold the information for how many heads? Heads, not only does it use that information to tell the cells what to do to regenerate, but it stores it. Once you've reset it, it keeps. And we can go back, we can take a two headed animal and put it back to one headed. So there's a couple of interesting things here that have implications for understanding genomes and things like that. Imagine I take this two headed animal, oh, and by the way, when they reproduce, when they tear themselves in half, you still get two headed animals. Imagine I take them and I throw them in the Charles river over here. 100 years later, some scientists come along and they scoop up some samples and they go, oh, oh, here's a single headed form and a two headed form. Wow, a speciation event. Cool. Let's sequence the genome and see what happened. The genomes are identical, there's nothing wrong with the genome. So if you ask the question, how does, so this goes back to your very first question is where do body plans come from? Right. How does the planarian know how many heads it's supposed to have? Now it's interesting because you could say DNA, but as it turns out, the DNA produces a piece of hardware that by default says one head. The way that when you turn on a calculator, by default it says zero every single time. Right. When you turn it on just says zero. But it's a programmable calculator as it turns out. So once you've changed that, next time it won't say zero, it'll say something else. And the same thing here. So you can make one headed, two headed, you can make no headed worms. We've done some other things along these lines, some other really weird constructs. So this question of. Right, so again, it's really important. The hardware software distinction is really important. Important because the hardware is essential, because without proper hardware you're never going to get to the right physiology of having that memory. But once you have it, it doesn't fully determine what the information is going to be. You can have other information in there and it's reprogrammable by us, by bacteria, by various parasites, probably, things like that. The other amazing thing about these planarias, think about this. Most animals, when we get a mutation in our bodies, our children don't inherit it. Right. So you could go on, you could run around for 50, 60 years getting mutations. Your children don't have those mutations. Mutations. Because we go through the egg stage, planaria tear themselves in half, and that's how they reproduce. So for 400 million years, they keep every mutation that they've had that doesn't kill the cell that it's in. So when you look at these planaria, their bodies are what's called mixiploid, meaning that every cell might have a different number of chromosomes. They look like a tumor. If you look at. The genome is an incredible mess because they accumulate all this stuff, and yet their body structure is. They are the best regenerators on the planet. Their anatomy is rock solid, even though their genome is all kinds of crap. So this is kind of a scandal, right, that when we learn that what are genomes do? What genomes determine your body. Okay. Why does the animal with the worst genome have the best anatomical control, the most cancer resistant, the most regenerative? Really, we're just beginning to start to understand this relationship between the genomically determined hardware and by the way, just as of a couple of months ago, I think I now somewhat understand why this is. But it's really a major puzzle.",

      "transcript_text": "Exactly. If you cut their head off, the tail doesn't have. That doesn't do anything. It just sits there until the new brain is. Until a new brain regenerates. They have all the same neurotransmitters that you and I have, but here's why we're talking about them in this context. So here's your planaria. You cut off the head, you cut off the tail. You have a middle fragment. That middle fragment has to make one head and one tail. How does it know how many of each to make and where do they go? How come it doesn't switch? How come? Right. So we did a very simple thing and we said, okay, let's make the hypothesis that, that there's a somatic electrical network that remembers the correct pattern and that what it's doing is recalling that memory and building to that pattern. So what we did was we used a way to visualize electrical activity in these cells. It's a variant of what people use to look for electricity in the brain. And we saw that that fragment has a very particular electrical pattern. You can literally see it. Once we developed the technique, it has a very particular electrical pattern pattern that shows you where the head and the tail goes. Right? You can, you can just see it. And then we said, okay, well now let's test the idea that that's a memory that actually controls where the head and the tail goes. Let's change that pattern. So basically incept a false memory. And so what you can do is you can do that in many different ways. One way is with drugs that target ion channels to say. And so you pick these drugs and you say, okay, I'm going to do it. So that instead of this one head, one tail electrical pattern, you have a two headed pattern. You're just editing the electrical information in the network. When you do that, guess what the cells build. They build a two headed worm. And the coolest thing about it now, no genetic changes. So we haven't touched the genome. The genome is Totally wild type. But the amazing thing about it is that when you take these two headed animals and you cut them into pieces again, some of those pieces will continue to make two headed animals. So that information, that memory, that electrical circuit, not only does it hold the information for how many heads? Heads, not only does it use that information to tell the cells what to do to regenerate, but it stores it. Once you've reset it, it keeps. And we can go back, we can take a two headed animal and put it back to one headed. So there's a couple of interesting things here that have implications for understanding genomes and things like that. Imagine I take this two headed animal, oh, and by the way, when they reproduce, when they tear themselves in half, you still get two headed animals. Imagine I take them and I throw them in the Charles river over here. 100 years later, some scientists come along and they scoop up some samples and they go, oh, oh, here's a single headed form and a two headed form. Wow, a speciation event. Cool. Let's sequence the genome and see what happened. The genomes are identical, there's nothing wrong with the genome. So if you ask the question, how does, so this goes back to your very first question is where do body plans come from? Right. How does the planarian know how many heads it's supposed to have? Now it's interesting because you could say DNA, but as it turns out, the DNA produces a piece of hardware that by default says one head. The way that when you turn on a calculator, by default it says zero every single time. Right. When you turn it on just says zero. But it's a programmable calculator as it turns out. So once you've changed that, next time it won't say zero, it'll say something else. And the same thing here. So you can make one headed, two headed, you can make no headed worms. We've done some other things along these lines, some other really weird constructs. So this question of. Right, so again, it's really important. The hardware software distinction is really important. Important because the hardware is essential, because without proper hardware you're never going to get to the right physiology of having that memory. But once you have it, it doesn't fully determine what the information is going to be. You can have other information in there and it's reprogrammable by us, by bacteria, by various parasites, probably, things like that. The other amazing thing about these planarias, think about this. Most animals, when we get a mutation in our bodies, our children don't inherit it. Right. So you could go on, you could run around for 50, 60 years getting mutations. Your children don't have those mutations. Mutations. Because we go through the egg stage, planaria tear themselves in half, and that's how they reproduce. So for 400 million years, they keep every mutation that they've had that doesn't kill the cell that it's in. So when you look at these planaria, their bodies are what's called mixiploid, meaning that every cell might have a different number of chromosomes. They look like a tumor. If you look at. The genome is an incredible mess because they accumulate all this stuff, and yet their body structure is. They are the best regenerators on the planet. Their anatomy is rock solid, even though their genome is all kinds of crap. So this is kind of a scandal, right, that when we learn that what are genomes do? What genomes determine your body. Okay. Why does the animal with the worst genome have the best anatomical control, the most cancer resistant, the most regenerative? Really, we're just beginning to start to understand this relationship between the genomically determined hardware and by the way, just as of a couple of months ago, I think I now somewhat understand why this is. But it's really a major puzzle.",

Really, we're just beginning to start to understand this relationship between the genomically determined hardware and by the way, just as of a couple of months ago, I think I now somewhat understand why this is. But it's really a major puzzle. Puzzle that really throws a wrench into the whole nature versus nurture, because you usually associate electricity with the nurture and the hardware with the nature, and there's just this weird integrated mess that propagates through generations. Yeah, it's much more fluid, it's much more complex. You can imagine what's happening here is just imagine the evolution of an animal like multiscale. This goes back to this multiscale competency. Right. Imagine that you have an animal where its tissues have some degree of multiscale competency. So, for example, like we saw in the tadpole, if you put an eye on its tail, they can still see out of that eye. There's incredible plasticity. So if you have an animal and it comes up for selection and the fitness is quite good, evolution doesn't know whether the fitness is good because the genome was awesome or because the genome was kind of junky, but the competency made up for it. Right? And things kind of ended up good. So what that means is that the more competency you have, the harder it is for selection to pick the best genomes. It hides information. Right. And so that means that. So what happens? Evolution basically starts. All the hard work is being done to increase the competency because it's harder and harder to see the genomes. And so I think in planaria, what happened is that there's this runaway. A phenomenon where all the effort went into the algorithm, such that we know you got a crappy genome, we can't clean up the genome, we can't keep track of it. So what's going to happen is what survives are the algorithms that can create a great worm no matter what the genome is. So everything went into the algorithm, which of course then reduces the pressure on keeping a clean genome. So this idea of. And different animals have this to different levels, but this idea of putting energy into an algorithm that, that does not overtrain on priors. Right. It can't assume. I mean, I think biology is this way. In general, evolution doesn't take the past too seriously because it makes these basically problem solving machines as opposed to exactly what to deal with. Exactly what happened last time.",

Yeah, it's much more fluid, it's much more complex. You can imagine what's happening here is just imagine the evolution of an animal like multiscale. This goes back to this multiscale competency. Right. Imagine that you have an animal where its tissues have some degree of multiscale competency. So, for example, like we saw in the tadpole, if you put an eye on its tail, they can still see out of that eye. There's incredible plasticity. So if you have an animal and it comes up for selection and the fitness is quite good, evolution doesn't know whether the fitness is good because the genome was awesome or because the genome was kind of junky, but the competency made up for it. Right? And things kind of ended up good. So what that means is that the more competency you have, the harder it is for selection to pick the best genomes. It hides information. Right. And so that means that. So what happens? Evolution basically starts. All the hard work is being done to increase the competency because it's harder and harder to see the genomes. And so I think in planaria, what happened is that there's this runaway. A phenomenon where all the effort went into the algorithm, such that we know you got a crappy genome, we can't clean up the genome, we can't keep track of it. So what's going to happen is what survives are the algorithms that can create a great worm no matter what the genome is. So everything went into the algorithm, which of course then reduces the pressure on keeping a clean genome. So this idea of. And different animals have this to different levels, but this idea of putting energy into an algorithm that, that does not overtrain on priors. Right. It can't assume. I mean, I think biology is this way. In general, evolution doesn't take the past too seriously because it makes these basically problem solving machines as opposed to exactly what to deal with.

Are you trying to be provocative with the word xenobots versus biological robots? I don't know this. Yeah. Is there some drama that we should be aware of? There's a little bit of drama, I think, I think the drama is basically related to people having very fixed ideas about what terms mean. And I think in many cases these ideas are completely out of date with where science is now. And for sure they're out of date with what's going to be. I mean, these concepts are not going to survive the next couple of decades. So if you ask a person, and including a lot of people in biology who kind of want to keep a sharp distinction between biologicals and robots. Right. See, what's a robot? What? Well, a robot, it comes out of a factory. It's made by humans. It is boring. It is meaning that you can predict everything it's going to do. It's made of metal and certain other inorganic materials. Living organisms are magical. They, they, they arise. Right. And so on. So there's these distinctions, I think these, these distinctions I think were. Were never Good. But they're going to be completely useless going forward. And so part of. There's a couple of papers that, that's one paper and there's another one that Josh Baungard and I wrote where we really a attack the terminology and we say these binary categories are based on very non essential kind of surface limitations of technology and imagination that were true before, but they've got to go. And so we call them xenobots. So xeno for Xenopus laevis, it's the frog that these guys are made of. But we think it's an example of a biobot technology because ultimately if we, once we understand how to communicate and manipulate the inputs to these cells, we will be able to get them to build whatever we want them to build. And that's robotics. Right. It's the rational construction of machines that have useful purposes. I absolutely think that this is a robotics platform, whereas some biologists don't. But it's built in a way that all the different components are doing their own computation. So in the way that we've been talking about. So you're trying to do top down control.",

      "transcript_text": "There's a little bit of drama, I think, I think the drama is basically related to people having very fixed ideas about what terms mean. And I think in many cases these ideas are completely out of date with where science is now. And for sure they're out of date with what's going to be. I mean, these concepts are not going to survive the next couple of decades. So if you ask a person, and including a lot of people in biology who kind of want to keep a sharp distinction between biologicals and robots. Right. See, what's a robot? What? Well, a robot, it comes out of a factory. It's made by humans. It is boring. It is meaning that you can predict everything it's going to do. It's made of metal and certain other inorganic materials. Living organisms are magical. They, they, they arise. Right. And so on. So there's these distinctions, I think these, these distinctions I think were. Were never Good. But they're going to be completely useless going forward. And so part of. There's a couple of papers that, that's one paper and there's another one that Josh Baungard and I wrote where we really a attack the terminology and we say these binary categories are based on very non essential kind of surface limitations of technology and imagination that were true before, but they've got to go. And so we call them xenobots. So xeno for Xenopus laevis, it's the frog that these guys are made of. But we think it's an example of a biobot technology because ultimately if we, once we understand how to communicate and manipulate the inputs to these cells, we will be able to get them to build whatever we want them to build. And that's robotics. Right. It's the rational construction of machines that have useful purposes. I absolutely think that this is a robotics platform, whereas some biologists don't. But it's built in a way that all the different components are doing their own computation. So in the way that we've been talking about. So you're trying to do top down control. And in the future all of this will merge together because of course at some point we're going to throw in synthetic biology circuits, right? New transcriptional circuits to get them to do new things. Of course we'll throw some of that in. But we specifically stayed away from all of that because in the first few papers, and there's some more coming down the pike that are, I think going to be pretty dynamite that we want to show what the native cells are made of. Because what happens is if you engineer the heck out of them, if we were to put in new transcription factors and some new metabolic machinery and we, whatever people will say, okay, you engineered this and you made it do whatever. And fine, I wanted to show, and the whole team wanted to show the plasticity and the intelligence in the biology. What does it do that's surprising before you even start manipulating the hardware in that way. Yeah, don't try to over control the thing, let it flourish. The full beauty of the biological system. Why Xenopus left Lavis, how do you pronounce it? The frog? Cenopus lavis. Yeah, yeah, it's a very popular. Why this frog? It's been used since I think the 50s. It's just very convenient because you can, you, you know, we keep the adults in this, in this very fine frog habitat, they lay eggs. They lay tens of thousands of eggs at a time. The eggs develop right in front of Your eyes. It's the most magical thing you can. You can see because normally, you know, if you were to deal with mice or rabbits or whatever, you don't see the early stages. Right. Because everything's inside them. Mother here, everything's in a petri dish at room temperature. So you have an egg, it's fertilized, and you can just watch it divide and divide and divide, and all the organs form. You can just see it. And at that point, the community has developed lots of different tools for understanding what's going on and also for manipulating it. Right. So people use it for understanding birth defects and neurobiology and cancer immunology also. So you get the whole embryogenesis in the petri dish. Yep.",

You know, it's easy to raise in the laboratory, and it's very prolific. And all the tools, basically, for decades, people have been developing tools. There's other. Some people use other frogs, but I have to say this is important. Xenobots are fundamentally not anything about frogs. So I can't say too much about this because it's not published and peer reviewed yet. But we've made xenobots out of other things that have nothing to do with frogs. This is not a frog phenomenon. This is. We. We started with frog because it's so convenient, but this, this. This plasticity is not a frog. You know, it's not related to the fact that they're frogs. What happens when you kiss it? Does it turn to a prince? No. Or princess? Which. Wait, prince? Yeah, Prince should be a prince. Yeah. That's an experiment that I don't believe we've done. And if we have, I don't collaborate. I can. I can take on the lead on that effort. Okay, cool. How does the south core. Nate, let's focus in on just the embryogenesis. So there's one cell, so it divides. Doesn't have to be very careful about what each cell starts doing once they divide. Yes. And, like, when there's three of them, it's like the co Founders or whatever. Like what? Like slow down, you're responsible for this. When do they become specialized and how do they coordinate that specialization? So, so this is the, the basic science of developmental biology. There's a lot known about all of that. But, but what I'll tell you what I think is the kind of, the most important part, which is, yes, it's very important who does what. However, because going back to this issue of I made this claim that biology doesn't take the past too seriously. And what I mean by that is it doesn't assume that everything is the way it's expected to be. Right? And here's an example of that. This was done, this was an old experiment going back to the 40s, but basically imagine it's a newt salamander and it's got these little tubules that go to the kidneys. It's a little tube. Take a cross section of that tube. You see eight to 10 cells that have cooperated to make this little tube in cross section. One amazing thing you can do is you can mess with the very early cell division to make the cells gigantic, bigger. You can make them different sizes, you can force them to be different sizes. So if you make the cells different sizes, the whole nude is still the same size. So if you take a cross section through that tubule, instead of eight to ten cells, you might have four or five, or you might have three, until you make the cell so enormous that one single cell wraps around itself and gives you that same large scale structure, but a completely different molecular mechanism. So now instead of cell to cell communication to make a tubule, instead of that, it's one cell using the cytoskeleton to bend itself around. So think about what that means in the service of a large scale. Talk about top down control, right? In the service of a large scale anatomical feature, different molecular mechanisms get called up. So now think about this. You're a new cell and trying to make an embryo. If you had a fixed idea of who was supposed to do what, you'd be screwed. Because now your cells are gigantic. Nothing would work. There's an incredible tolerance for changes in the size of the parts, in the amount of DNA in those parts, all sorts of stuff. The life is highly interoperable. You can put electrodes in there, you can put weird nanomaterials. It still works. This is that problem solving action. It's able to do what it needs to do even when circumstances change. That is the hallmark of intelligence. William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same Goal by different means. That's this. You get to the same goal by completely different means. And so why am I bringing this up is just to say that, yeah, it's important for the cells to do the right stuff, but they have incredible tolerances for things not being what you expect and to still get their job done. So if you're, you know, all of these things are not hardwired. There are organisms that might be hardwired. For example, the nematode C. Elegans. In that organism, every cell is numbered, meaning that every C. Elegans has exactly the same number of cells as every other C. Elegans. They're all in the same place, they all divide. There's literally really a map of how it works in that sort of system. It's much more cookie cutter. But most organisms are incredibly plastic in that way.",

      "transcript_text": "So, so this is the, the basic science of developmental biology. There's a lot known about all of that. But, but what I'll tell you what I think is the kind of, the most important part, which is, yes, it's very important who does what. However, because going back to this issue of I made this claim that biology doesn't take the past too seriously. And what I mean by that is it doesn't assume that everything is the way it's expected to be. Right? And here's an example of that. This was done, this was an old experiment going back to the 40s, but basically imagine it's a newt salamander and it's got these little tubules that go to the kidneys. It's a little tube. Take a cross section of that tube. You see eight to 10 cells that have cooperated to make this little tube in cross section. One amazing thing you can do is you can mess with the very early cell division to make the cells gigantic, bigger. You can make them different sizes, you can force them to be different sizes. So if you make the cells different sizes, the whole nude is still the same size. So if you take a cross section through that tubule, instead of eight to ten cells, you might have four or five, or you might have three, until you make the cell so enormous that one single cell wraps around itself and gives you that same large scale structure, but a completely different molecular mechanism. So now instead of cell to cell communication to make a tubule, instead of that, it's one cell using the cytoskeleton to bend itself around. So think about what that means in the service of a large scale. Talk about top down control, right? In the service of a large scale anatomical feature, different molecular mechanisms get called up. So now think about this. You're a new cell and trying to make an embryo. If you had a fixed idea of who was supposed to do what, you'd be screwed. Because now your cells are gigantic. Nothing would work. There's an incredible tolerance for changes in the size of the parts, in the amount of DNA in those parts, all sorts of stuff. The life is highly interoperable. You can put electrodes in there, you can put weird nanomaterials. It still works. This is that problem solving action. It's able to do what it needs to do even when circumstances change. That is the hallmark of intelligence. William James defined intelligence as the ability to get to the same Goal by different means. That's this. You get to the same goal by completely different means. And so why am I bringing this up is just to say that, yeah, it's important for the cells to do the right stuff, but they have incredible tolerances for things not being what you expect and to still get their job done. So if you're, you know, all of these things are not hardwired. There are organisms that might be hardwired. For example, the nematode C. Elegans. In that organism, every cell is numbered, meaning that every C. Elegans has exactly the same number of cells as every other C. Elegans. They're all in the same place, they all divide. There's literally really a map of how it works in that sort of system. It's much more cookie cutter. But most organisms are incredibly plastic in that way. Is there something particularly magical to you about the whole developmental biology process? Is there something you could say because you just said it, they're very good at accomplishing the goal, the job. They need to do the competency thing. But you get freaking organism from one cell, cell. It's like, I mean, it's very hard, hard to intuit that whole process, to even think about reverse engineering that process. Right. Very hard. To the point where I often just imagine, I sometimes ask my students to do this thought experiment. Imagine you were shrunk down to the scale of a single cell and you were in the middle of an embryo and you were looking around at what's going on and the cells running around. Some cells are dying. Every time you look, it's kind of a different number of cells for most organisms and so, so on. I think that if you didn't know what embryonic development was, you would have no clue that what you're seeing is always going to make the same thing. Never mind knowing what that is, never mind being able to say, even with full genomic information, being able to say, what the hell are they building? We have no way to do that. But just even to guess that, wow, the outcome of all this activity is it's always going to build the same thing. The imperative to create the final you as you are now is there already. So you can, you would. So if you start from the same embryo, you would create a very similar organism.",

      "transcript_text": "You've talked about the magic and the power of biology here. If we look at the human brain, how special is the brain in this context? You're kind of minimizing the importance of the brain or lessening its. We think of all the special computation happens in the brain. Everything else is like the help. You're kind of saying that the whole thing is doing computation. But nevertheless, how special is the human brain in this full context of biology? Yeah, I mean, look, there's no getting away from the fact that the human brain allows us to do things that we could not do without it. You can say the same thing about the liver. Yeah, this is, this is true. And so, and so, you know, I, I, my goal is not. No, you're right. My goal is you're just being polite. To the brain right now. Well, being a politician, like, listen, everybody. Has, everybody has a role. Yeah. And it's a very important role. That's right. We have to acknowledge the importance, importance of the brain. You know, there are more than enough people who are cheerleading the brain. Right. So, so I, I don't feel like nothing I say is going to reduce people's excitement about the human brain. And so, so I, I emphasize other. Things too much credit. I don't think it gets too much credit. I think other things don't get enough credit. I think the brain is, is the, the human brain is incredible and special and all that. I think other things need more credit. And, and I also think that, that this, and I'm sort of this way about everything. I don't like binary categories about almost anything. I like a continuum. And the thing about the human brain is that by accepting that as some kind of an important category or essential thing, we end up with all kinds of weird pseudo problems and conundrums. So for example, when we talk about it, if you want to talk about ethics and other things like that, and this idea that surely if we look out into the universe, surely we don't believe that this human brain is the only way to be sentient. Surely we don't. And to have high level cognition, I can't even wrap my mind around this idea that that is the only way to do it. No doubt there are other architectures made of completely different principles that achieve the same thing. And once we believe that, then that that tells us something important. It tells us that things that are not quite human brains or chimeras of human brains and other tissue or human brains or other kinds of brains in novel configurations or things that are sort of brains but not really, or plants or embryos or whatever might also have important cognitive status. So that's the only thing I think we have to be really careful about treating the human brain as if it was some kind of sharp binary category. You are or you are, aren't. I, I don't believe that exists. So when we look out at all the beautiful variety of semi biological architectures out there in the universe, how many, how many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there? Boy, I have, you know, no expertise in that whatsoever. You haven't, you haven't met any? I, I have met the ones we've made.",

So we absolutely have to create novel examples that have no history on Earth that don't, you know, xenobots have no history of selection to be a good xenobot. The cells have selection for various things, but the xenobot itself never existed before. And so we can make chimeras. You know, we make frog a lottles that are sort of half frog, half axolotl. You can make all sorts of hybrids, right, Constructions of living tissue with robots and whatever. We need to be making these things until we find actual aliens, because otherwise we're just looking at an N of one set of examples. All kinds of frozen accidents of evolution and so on. We need to go beyond that to really understand biology. But we're still, even when you're doing synthetic biology, you're locked in to the basic components of the way biology is done on this earth. Yeah, right, yeah, yeah. And also limited. And the, and also the basic constraints of the environment, even artificial environments that construct in the lab are tied up to the environment. I mean, what do you, okay, let's Say there is. I mean, what I think is there's. There's. A nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations, living or dead, out there.

      "transcript_text": "I absolutely think so. Because look, all of life, all standard model systems, are an N of one course of evolution on Earth, right? And trying to make conclusions about biology from looking at life on Earth is like testing your theory on the same data that generated it. It's all kind of like locked in. So we absolutely have to create novel examples that have no history on Earth that don't, you know, xenobots have no history of selection to be a good xenobot. The cells have selection for various things, but the xenobot itself never existed before. And so we can make chimeras. You know, we make frog a lottles that are sort of half frog, half axolotl. You can make all sorts of hybrids, right, Constructions of living tissue with robots and whatever. We need to be making these things until we find actual aliens, because otherwise we're just looking at an N of one set of examples. All kinds of frozen accidents of evolution and so on. We need to go beyond that to really understand biology. But we're still, even when you're doing synthetic biology, you're locked in to the basic components of the way biology is done on this earth. Yeah, right, yeah, yeah. And also limited. And the, and also the basic constraints of the environment, even artificial environments that construct in the lab are tied up to the environment. I mean, what do you, okay, let's Say there is. I mean, what I think is there's. There's. A nearly infinite number of intelligent civilizations, living or dead, out there. If you pick one out of the box, what do you think it would look like? So when you think about synthetic biology or creating synthetic organisms, how hard is it to create something that's very difficult. Different? Yeah, I think it's very hard to create something that's very different. Right. It's. We are just locked in both, both. Both experimentally and in terms of our imagination. Right. It's very hard. And you also emphasize several times the. The idea of shape. Yeah. The individual cell get together with other cells and they kind of. They're going to build a shape. So it's shape and function, but shape is a critical thing. Yeah. So here I'll take a stab. I mean, I agree with you to whatever extent that we can say anything. I do think that there's probably an infinite number of different architectures with interesting cognitive properties out there. What can we say about them? I think that the only things that are going. I don't think we can rely on any of the typical stuff. Carbon based, none of that. I think all of that is just us having a lack of imagination. But I think the things that are going to be universal, if anything is, are things, for example, driven by resource limitation. The fact that you are fighting a hostile world and you have to draw a boundary between yourself and the world somewhere. The fact that that boundary is not given to you by anybody, you have to assume it, estimate it yourself. And the fact that you have to coarse grain your experience and the fact that you're going to try to minimize surprise. And the fact that these are the things that I think are fundamental about biology. None of the facts about the genetic code or even the fact that we have genes or the biochemistry of it. I don't think any of those things are fundamental. But it's going to be a lot more about the information and about the creation of the self. The fact that in my framework, selves are demarcated by the scale of the goals that they can pursue. So from little tiny local goals to massive planetary scale goals for certain humans.

I think those kinds of frameworks like that, like active inference and so on, are going to be universally applicable. But none of the other things that are typically discussed. Quick pause. Do you need a bathroom break? We were just talking about aliens and all that. And that's a funny thing which is I don't know if you've seen there's a kind of debate that goes on about cognition and planning plants and what can you say about different kinds of computation and cognition in plants. And I always, I always look at that stuff like if, if you're weirded out by cognition in plants, you're not ready for exobiology. Right. If, if, if you know something that's that similar here on Earth is already like freaking you out, then I think there's going to be all kinds of cognitive life out there that we're gonna have a really hard time recognizing. I think robots will help us. Yeah. Like expand our mind about cognition. Either that or the word like xenobots. So. And they maybe becomes the same thing is, you know, really when the human engineers the thing, at least in part, and then is able to achieve some kind of cognition that's different than what you're used to, then you start to understand like, oh, you know, every living organism is capable of cognition. Oh, I need to cut of broaden my understanding of what cognition is. But do you think plants, like when you, when you eat them, are they screaming? I don't know about screaming. I think you have to. That's what I think when I eat a salad. Yeah, Good. Yeah. I think you have to scale down the expectations in terms of. Right. So, so probably they're not screaming in the way that we would be screaming. However, there's plenty of data on plants being able to, to do anticipation and certain kinds of memory and certain so on. I think what you just said about robots, I hope you're right and I hope that's. But there's two ways that people can take that. Right. So one way is exactly what you just said to try to kind of expand their notions for that category. The other way people often go is they just sort of define the term. If it's not a natural product, it's just faking. Right. It's not really intelligence if it was made by somebody else. Because it's that same, it's the same thing. They can see how it's done, done. And once you see how it's. It's like a magic trick. When you see how it's done, it's not as fun anymore. And I think people have a real tendency for that. And they sort of. Which I find really strange in the sense that if somebody said to me we have this sort of blind hill climbing search and then we have a really smart team of engineers. Which one do you think is going to produce a system that has good intelligence. I think it's really weird to say that it only comes from the blind search. Right. It can't be done. Done by people who by the way can also use evolutionary techniques if they want to, but also rational design. I think it's really weird to say that real intelligence only comes from natural evolution. So I hope you're right. I hope people take it in the other. The other way.",

And they maybe becomes the same thing is, you know, really when the human engineers the thing, at least in part, and then is able to achieve some kind of cognition that's different than what you're used to, then you start to understand like, oh, you know, every living organism is capable of cognition. Oh, I need to cut of broaden my understanding of what cognition is. But do you think plants, like when you, when you eat them, are they screaming? I don't know about screaming. I think you have to. That's what I think when I eat a salad. Yeah, Good. Yeah. I think you have to scale down the expectations in terms of. Right. So, so probably they're not screaming in the way that we would be screaming. However, there's plenty of data on plants being able to, to do anticipation and certain kinds of memory and certain so on. I think what you just said about robots, I hope you're right and I hope that's. But there's two ways that people can take that. Right. So one way is exactly what you just said to try to kind of expand their notions for that category. The other way people often go is they just sort of define the term. If it's not a natural product, it's just faking. Right. It's not really intelligence if it was made by somebody else. Because it's that same, it's the same thing. They can see how it's done, done. And once you see how it's. It's like a magic trick. When you see how it's done, it's not as fun anymore. And I think people have a real tendency for that. And they sort of. Which I find really strange in the sense that if somebody said to me we have this sort of blind hill climbing search and then we have a really smart team of engineers. Which one do you think is going to produce a system that has good intelligence. I think it's really weird to say that it only comes from the blind search. Right. It can't be done. Done by people who by the way can also use evolutionary techniques if they want to, but also rational design. I think it's really weird to say that real intelligence only comes from natural evolution. So I hope you're right. I hope people take it in the other. The other way. But there's a nice shortcut. So I work with Lego robots a lot now for my own personal pleasure. Not in that way. Internet. So four legs. And one of the things that changes my experience of the robots a lot is when I can't understand why I did a certain thing. And there's a lot of ways to engineer that. Me, the person that created the software that runs it. There's a lot of ways for me to build that software in such a way that I don't exactly know why it did a certain basic decision. Of course as an engineer you can go in and start to look at logs. You can log all kind of data, sensory data, the decisions you made, all the outputs in neural networks and so on. But I also try to really experience that surprise and that really experience as another person would that totally doesn't know how it's built.

And I think the magic is there in not knowing how it works that, that. I think biology does that for you through the layers of abstraction. Yeah it. Because nobody really knows what's going on inside the biological. Like each one component is clueless about the big picture. I think there's actually really cheap systems that can, that can illustrate that kind of thing which is even like, you know, fractals. Right. Like you have a very small short formula in Z and you see it and there's no magic. You're just going to crank through Z squared plus C whatever. You're just going to crank through it. But the result of it is this incredibly rich, beautiful image that just like wow, all of that was in this 10 character long string. Amazing. So the fact that you can know everything there is to know about the details and the process and all the parts and everything. There's literally no magic of any kind there there. And yet the outcome is something that you would never have expected. And it just is incredibly rich and complex and beautiful. So there's a lot of that. You write that you work on developing conceptual frameworks for understanding unconventional cognition. So the kind of thing we've been talking about, I just like the term unconventional cognition. And you want to figure out how to detect, study and communicate with a third thing. You've already mentioned a few examples. But what is unconventional cognition? Is it as simply as everything outside, outside of what we define usually as cognition, cognitive science, the stuff going on between our ears? Or is there some deeper way to get at the fundamentals of what is cognition? Yeah, I think like, and, and I'm certainly not the only person who works in unconventional. Unconventional cognition. So it's the term used. Yeah, that's one that. So I've coined a number of weird terms, but that's not one of mine. Like, that's an existing thing. So, for example, somebody like Andy Adamatsky, who I don't know if you've had him on, if you haven't, you should. He's a very interesting guy. He's a computer scientist and he does unconventional cognition and slime molds and all kinds of weird. He's a real weird cat. Really interesting. Anyway, so there's a bunch of terms that I've got up with, but that's not one of mine. So I think, like many terms, that one is really defined by the times, meaning that things that are unconventional cognition today are not going to be considered unconventional cognition at some point. It's one of those things. And so it's this really deep question of how do you recognize, communicate with, classify by cognition when you cannot rely on the typical milestones. Again, if you stick with the history of life on Earth, these exact model systems, you would say, ah, here's a particular structure of the brain, and this one has fewer of those, and this one has a bigger frontal cortex and this one. So these are landmarks that we're used to, and it allows us to make very kind of rapid judgments about things. But if you can't rely on that either because you're looking at a synthetic thing or an engineered thing or an alien thing thing, then what do you do? Right. How do you. And so, and so that's what I'm really interested in. I'm interested in, mind, in all of its possible implementations, not just the obvious ones that we know from looking at brains here on Earth.",

Like you have a very small short formula in Z and you see it and there's no magic. You're just going to crank through Z squared plus C whatever. You're just going to crank through it. But the result of it is this incredibly rich, beautiful image that just like wow, all of that was in this 10 character long string. Amazing. So the fact that you can know everything there is to know about the details and the process and all the parts and everything. There's literally no magic of any kind there there. And yet the outcome is something that you would never have expected. And it just is incredibly rich and complex and beautiful. So there's a lot of that. You write that you work on developing conceptual frameworks for understanding unconventional cognition. So the kind of thing we've been talking about, I just like the term unconventional cognition. And you want to figure out how to detect, study and communicate with a third thing. You've already mentioned a few examples. But what is unconventional cognition? Is it as simply as everything outside, outside of what we define usually as cognition, cognitive science, the stuff going on between our ears? Or is there some deeper way to get at the fundamentals of what is cognition? Yeah, I think like, and, and I'm certainly not the only person who works in unconventional. Unconventional cognition. So it's the term used. Yeah, that's one that. So I've coined a number of weird terms, but that's not one of mine. Like, that's an existing thing. So, for example, somebody like Andy Adamatsky, who I don't know if you've had him on, if you haven't, you should. He's a very interesting guy. He's a computer scientist and he does unconventional cognition and slime molds and all kinds of weird. He's a real weird cat. Really interesting. Anyway, so there's a bunch of terms that I've got up with, but that's not one of mine. So I think, like many terms, that one is really defined by the times, meaning that things that are unconventional cognition today are not going to be considered unconventional cognition at some point. It's one of those things. And so it's this really deep question of how do you recognize, communicate with, classify by cognition when you cannot rely on the typical milestones. Again, if you stick with the history of life on Earth, these exact model systems, you would say, ah, here's a particular structure of the brain, and this one has fewer of those, and this one has a bigger frontal cortex and this one. So these are landmarks that we're used to, and it allows us to make very kind of rapid judgments about things. But if you can't rely on that either because you're looking at a synthetic thing or an engineered thing or an alien thing thing, then what do you do? Right. How do you. And so, and so that's what I'm really interested in. I'm interested in, mind, in all of its possible implementations, not just the obvious ones that we know from looking at brains here on Earth. Whenever I think about something like unconventional cognition, I think about cellular automata. I'm just captivated by the beauty of the thing, the fact that from simple little objects you can create some such beautiful complexity that very quickly you forget about the individual objects and you see the things that it creates as its own organisms. That blows my mind every time. Like, honestly, I could full time just eat mushrooms and watch Celia Tom don't even have to do mushrooms. Just. Just cellular automata, it feels like. I mean, from the engineering perspective, I love when a very simple system captures something really powerful, because then you can study that system to understand something fundamental about complexity, about life on Earth. Anyway, how do I communicate with a thing? For cellular automata can do cognition, if a plant can do cognition, if a xenobot can do cognition. How to, like, whisper in its ear and get an answer back, too. How do I have a conversation?",

But not just the ideas for a communication medium, not just the physical medium, but saliency. Right. So what's important to this system? And systems have all kinds of different levels of sophistication of what you could expect to get back. And I think what's really important, I call this the spectrum of persuadability, which is this idea that when you're looking at a system, you can't assume where on the spectrum it is. You have to do experiments. For example, if you look at a gene regulatory network, which is just a bunch of nodes that turn each other on and off at various rates, you might look at that and you say, wow, there's no magic here. I mean, clearly this thing is as deterministic as it gets. It's a piece of hardware. The only way we're going to be able to control it is by rewiring it, which is the way molecular biology works. We can add nodes, remember, move nodes or whatever. Well, so we've done simulations and shown that biological. And now we're doing this in the lab. The biological networks like that have associative memory. So they can actually learn. They can learn from experience. They have habituation, they have sensitization, they have associative memory, which you wouldn't have known if you assumed that they have to be on the left side of that spectrum. So when you're going to communicate with something, and we've even. Charles Abramsman and I have written a paper on behaviorist approaches to synthetic organism, meaning that if you're given something, you have no idea what it is or what it can do, how do you figure out what its psychology is, what its level is? What does it? And so we literally lay out a set of protocols, starting with the simplest things and then moving up to more complex things where you can make no assumptions about what this thing can do. Right. Just from. You have to start, and you'll find out. So here's a simple. I mean, here's one way to communicate with something. If you can train a it, that's a way of communicating. So if you can provide. If you can figure out what the currency of reward of positive and negative reinforcement is, and you can get it to do something it wasn't doing before based on experiences you've given it, you have taught it one thing, you have communicated one thing that such and such an action is good. Some other action is not good. That's like a basic atom of. A primitive atom of communication.",

For example, if you look at a gene regulatory network, which is just a bunch of nodes that turn each other on and off at various rates, you might look at that and you say, wow, there's no magic here. I mean, clearly this thing is as deterministic as it gets. It's a piece of hardware. The only way we're going to be able to control it is by rewiring it, which is the way molecular biology works. We can add nodes, remember, move nodes or whatever. Well, so we've done simulations and shown that biological. And now we're doing this in the lab. The biological networks like that have associative memory. So they can actually learn. They can learn from experience. They have habituation, they have sensitization, they have associative memory, which you wouldn't have known if you assumed that they have to be on the left side of that spectrum. So when you're going to communicate with something, and we've even. Charles Abramsman and I have written a paper on behaviorist approaches to synthetic organism, meaning that if you're given something, you have no idea what it is or what it can do, how do you figure out what its psychology is, what its level is? What does it? And so we literally lay out a set of protocols, starting with the simplest things and then moving up to more complex things where you can make no assumptions about what this thing can do. Right. Just from. You have to start, and you'll find out. So here's a simple. I mean, here's one way to communicate with something. If you can train a it, that's a way of communicating. So if you can provide. If you can figure out what the currency of reward of positive and negative reinforcement is, and you can get it to do something it wasn't doing before based on experiences you've given it, you have taught it one thing, you have communicated one thing that such and such an action is good. Some other action is not good. That's like a basic atom of. A primitive atom of communication. What about, in some sense, if it gets you to do something you haven't done before, is it answering back? Yeah, most. Most certainly. And there's. There's. I've seen cartoons. I think maybe Gary Larson or somebody had had a cartoon of these. Of these rats in the maze. And the one rat, you know, assist to the other. You look at this every time. Every time I walk over here, he starts scribbling in that on the, you know, on the clipboard that he has. It's awesome. If we step outside ourselves and really measure how much, like, if I. If I actually measure how much I've changed because of my interaction with certain cellular automata. I mean, you really have to take that into consideration about, like, well, these things are changing you too. Yes, I know. You know, how it works and so on, but you're being changed by the thing.",

      "transcript_text": "It's a really, really interesting line of investigation that. That opens up. I mean, I mean, we've thought about this. So you need a few things. You need to understand the space in which they live. So what? Not just the physical modality, like, can they see light, can they feel vibration? I mean, that's important, of course, because that's how you deliver your message. But not just the ideas for a communication medium, not just the physical medium, but saliency. Right. So what's important to this system? And systems have all kinds of different levels of sophistication of what you could expect to get back. And I think what's really important, I call this the spectrum of persuadability, which is this idea that when you're looking at a system, you can't assume where on the spectrum it is. You have to do experiments. For example, if you look at a gene regulatory network, which is just a bunch of nodes that turn each other on and off at various rates, you might look at that and you say, wow, there's no magic here.

I mean, you really have to take that into consideration about, like, well, these things are changing you too. Yes, I know. You know, how it works and so on, but you're being changed by the thing. Absolutely. I think. I think I read. I don't know any details, but I think I read something about how wheat and other things have domesticated human. Humans in terms of. Right. But by their properties, change the way that the human behavior and societal structures. In that sense, cats are running the world because they've took over the. So first of all, so first, they. While not giving a shit about humans, clearly with every ounce of their being, they've somehow got just millions and millions of humans to. To take them home and feed them. And then not only the physical space did they take over. They took over the digital space. They dominate the Internet in terms of cuteness, in terms of memeability. And so they're like. They got themselves literally inside the memes that become viral and spread on the Internet, and they're the ones that are probably controlling humans. That's my theory. Theory. Another. That's a follow up paper after the frog kissing. Okay. I mean, you mentioned sentience and consciousness. You have a paper titled Generalizing Frameworks for Sentience Beyond Natural Species. So beyond normal cognition. If we look at sentience and consciousness, and I wonder if you draw an interesting distinction between those two elsewhere, outside of humans and maybe outside of Earth, you think aliens have sentience, and if they do, how do we think about it? So when you have this framework, what is this paper? What is the way you propose to think about sentience is. Yeah, that particular paper was a very short commentary on another paper that was written about crabs. It was a really good paper on them. Crabs and various, like a rubric of different types of behaviors that could be applied to different creatures and they're trying to apply it to crabs and so on. Consciousness, we can talk about a few, but it's a whole separate kettle of fish. I almost never talk about consciousness in this case. Yes. I almost never talk about consciousness per se. I've said very little about it, but we can talk about it if you want. Mostly what I talk about is cognition because I think that that's much easier to deal with in a kind of rigorous experimental way. I think that all of these terms have sentience and so on, have different definitions. And fundamentally I think that people can, as long as they specify what they mean ahead of time, I think people can define them in various ways. The only thing that I really kind of insist on is that the right way to think about all this stuff from an engineering perspective, what does it help me to control, predict, and does it help me do my next experiment? So. So that's not a universal perspective. So some people have philosophical kind of underpinnings and those are primary. And if anything runs against that, then it must automatically be wrong. So some people will say, I don't care what else. If your theory says to me that thermostats have little tiny goals, I'm out. So that's it. That's my philosophical preconception that thermostats do not have goals, and that's it. So that's one way of doing it. And some people do it that way, I do not do it that way. And I think that we can't, we can't. I don't think we can know much of anything from a philosophical armchair. I think that all of these theories and ways of doing things stand or fall based on just basically one set of criteria. Does it help you run A rich research program. That's it.",

      "transcript_text": "In that sense, cats are running the world because they've took over the. So first of all, so first, they. While not giving a shit about humans, clearly with every ounce of their being, they've somehow got just millions and millions of humans to. To take them home and feed them. And then not only the physical space did they take over. They took over the digital space. They dominate the Internet in terms of cuteness, in terms of memeability. And so they're like. They got themselves literally inside the memes that become viral and spread on the Internet, and they're the ones that are probably controlling humans. That's my theory. Theory. Another. That's a follow up paper after the frog kissing. Okay. I mean, you mentioned sentience and consciousness. You have a paper titled Generalizing Frameworks for Sentience Beyond Natural Species. So beyond normal cognition. If we look at sentience and consciousness, and I wonder if you draw an interesting distinction between those two elsewhere, outside of humans and maybe outside of Earth, you think aliens have sentience, and if they do, how do we think about it? So when you have this framework, what is this paper? What is the way you propose to think about sentience is. Yeah, that particular paper was a very short commentary on another paper that was written about crabs. It was a really good paper on them. Crabs and various, like a rubric of different types of behaviors that could be applied to different creatures and they're trying to apply it to crabs and so on. Consciousness, we can talk about a few, but it's a whole separate kettle of fish. I almost never talk about consciousness in this case. Yes. I almost never talk about consciousness per se. I've said very little about it, but we can talk about it if you want. Mostly what I talk about is cognition because I think that that's much easier to deal with in a kind of rigorous experimental way. I think that all of these terms have sentience and so on, have different definitions. And fundamentally I think that people can, as long as they specify what they mean ahead of time, I think people can define them in various ways. The only thing that I really kind of insist on is that the right way to think about all this stuff from an engineering perspective, what does it help me to control, predict, and does it help me do my next experiment? So. So that's not a universal perspective. So some people have philosophical kind of underpinnings and those are primary. And if anything runs against that, then it must automatically be wrong. So some people will say, I don't care what else. If your theory says to me that thermostats have little tiny goals, I'm out. So that's it. That's my philosophical preconception that thermostats do not have goals, and that's it. So that's one way of doing it. And some people do it that way, I do not do it that way. And I think that we can't, we can't. I don't think we can know much of anything from a philosophical armchair. I think that all of these theories and ways of doing things stand or fall based on just basically one set of criteria. Does it help you run A rich research program. That's it.",

I think that all of these theories and ways of doing things stand or fall based on just basically one set of criteria. Does it help you run A rich research program. That's it. I agree with you totally. But so forget philosophy. What about the poetry of ambiguity? What about at the limits of the things you can engineer using terms that are, that can be defined in multiple ways and living within that uncertainty in order to play with words until something lands that you can engineer. I mean, that's, to me, where consciousness sits currently. Nobody really understands the, the, the hard problem of consciousness, the subject, what it feels like, because it really feels like. It feels like something to be this biological system, this conglomerate of a bunch of cells in this hierarchy of competencies feels like something. And yeah, I feel like one thing. And is that just, is that just a side effect of a complex system or is there something more that humans have or is there something more that any biological system has? Some kind of magic, some kind of, not just a sense of agency, but a real sense with a capital letter S of agency? Yeah. Ah, boy, yeah. That's a deep question. Is there room for poetry and engineering or no? No, there definitely is. And a lot of the poetry comes in when we realize that none of the categories we deal with are sharp as we think they are. Right. And so, and so in the, you know, in the different areas of all these spectra are where a lot of the poetry sits. I have many new theories about things, but fact do not have a, a good theory about consciousness that I plan to trot out. So. And you almost don't see it as useful for your current work to think about consciousness? I think it will come. I have some thoughts about it, but I don't feel like they're going to move the needle yet. On, on that particular. You want to ground in, in, in engineering, always so. Well, I mean, I don't. So, so, so, so if, if we really tackle consciousness per se in terms of the hard problem, I don't, I don't. That, that isn't necessarily going to be groundable in engineering. Right. That aspect of cognition is. But actual consciousness per se, you know, first person perspective. I'm not sure that that's groundable in engineering. And I think specifically what's different about it is there's a couple of things. So let's, you know, here we go. I'll say a couple of things about consciousness. One thing is that what makes it different is that for every other aspect of science, when we think about having a correct or a good theory of it, we have some idea of what format that theory makes predictions in. So whether those be numbers or whatever, we have some idea we may not know the answer, we may not have the theory, but we know that when we get the theory, here's what it's going to output, and then we'll know if it's right or wrong for actual consciousness. Not behavior, not neural correlates, but actual first person consciousness. If we had a correct theory of consciousness, or even a good one, what the hell, what format would it make predictions in? Because all the things that we know about basically boil down to observable behaviors. So the only thing I can think of when I think about that, it'll be poetry. Or it'll be something to. If I ask you, okay, you've got a great theory of consciousness, and here's this creature, maybe it's a natural one, maybe it's an engineer one, whatever. And I want you to tell me what your theory says about what it's like to be this being. The only thing I can imagine you giving me is some piece of art, a poem or something that once I've taken it in, I now have a similar state as whatever. That's about as good as I can come up with.",

      "transcript_text": "I agree with you totally. But so forget philosophy. What about the poetry of ambiguity? What about at the limits of the things you can engineer using terms that are, that can be defined in multiple ways and living within that uncertainty in order to play with words until something lands that you can engineer. I mean, that's, to me, where consciousness sits currently. Nobody really understands the, the, the hard problem of consciousness, the subject, what it feels like, because it really feels like. It feels like something to be this biological system, this conglomerate of a bunch of cells in this hierarchy of competencies feels like something. And yeah, I feel like one thing. And is that just, is that just a side effect of a complex system or is there something more that humans have or is there something more that any biological system has? Some kind of magic, some kind of, not just a sense of agency, but a real sense with a capital letter S of agency? Yeah. Ah, boy, yeah. That's a deep question. Is there room for poetry and engineering or no? No, there definitely is. And a lot of the poetry comes in when we realize that none of the categories we deal with are sharp as we think they are. Right. And so, and so in the, you know, in the different areas of all these spectra are where a lot of the poetry sits. I have many new theories about things, but fact do not have a, a good theory about consciousness that I plan to trot out. So. And you almost don't see it as useful for your current work to think about consciousness? I think it will come. I have some thoughts about it, but I don't feel like they're going to move the needle yet. On, on that particular. You want to ground in, in, in engineering, always so. Well, I mean, I don't. So, so, so, so if, if we really tackle consciousness per se in terms of the hard problem, I don't, I don't. That, that isn't necessarily going to be groundable in engineering. Right. That aspect of cognition is. But actual consciousness per se, you know, first person perspective. I'm not sure that that's groundable in engineering. And I think specifically what's different about it is there's a couple of things. So let's, you know, here we go. I'll say a couple of things about consciousness. One thing is that what makes it different is that for every other aspect of science, when we think about having a correct or a good theory of it, we have some idea of what format that theory makes predictions in. So whether those be numbers or whatever, we have some idea we may not know the answer, we may not have the theory, but we know that when we get the theory, here's what it's going to output, and then we'll know if it's right or wrong for actual consciousness. Not behavior, not neural correlates, but actual first person consciousness. If we had a correct theory of consciousness, or even a good one, what the hell, what format would it make predictions in? Because all the things that we know about basically boil down to observable behaviors. So the only thing I can think of when I think about that, it'll be poetry. Or it'll be something to. If I ask you, okay, you've got a great theory of consciousness, and here's this creature, maybe it's a natural one, maybe it's an engineer one, whatever. And I want you to tell me what your theory says about what it's like to be this being. The only thing I can imagine you giving me is some piece of art, a poem or something that once I've taken it in, I now have a similar state as whatever. That's about as good as I can come up with. Well, it's possible that once you have a good understanding of consciousness, it would be mapped to some things that are more measurable. So, for example, it's possible that a conscious being is one that's able to suffer. So you start to look at pain and suffering, you can start to connect it closer to things that you can measure that in terms of. Of how they reflect themselves in behavior and problem solving and creation and attainment of goals, for example, which I think suffering is one of the. You know, life is suffering. It's one of the. One of the big aspects of the human condition. And so if consciousness is somehow a, maybe at least a catalyst for suffering, suffering, you could start to get, like, echoes of it and start. You start to see, like, the actual effects of consciousness and behavior, that it's not just about subjective experience. It's like it's really deeply integrated in the problem solving, decision making of a system. Something like this. But also, it's possible that we realize this is not a philosophical statement. Philosophers can write their book, folks. I welcome it. You know, I. I take the Turing test really seriously. I. I don't know why people really don't like it when a robot convinces you that it's intelligent. I think that's a really incredible accomplishment. And there's some deep sense in which that is intelligence. If it looks like it's intelligent, it is intelligent. And I think there's some deep aspect of a system that appears to be conscious in some deep sense. It is conscious. At least for me. We have to consider that possibility. And a system that appears to be conscious is an engineering challenge.",

And I mean, you know, science fiction has dealt with this for a century or much more. Maybe this idea that when you are confronted with something that just doesn't meet any of your typical assumptions, so you can't look in the skull and say, oh, well, there's that frontal cortex. So then I guess we're good. Right. If it's. If it's, you know, so this thing lands on your front lawn and this, you know, with the little door opens and something trundles out, and it's sort of like, you know, kind of shiny and aluminum looking, and it hands you this, you know, it hands you this poem that it wrote while it was on, you know, flying over and how happy it is to meet you. Like, what. What's going to be your criteria, right, for whether. Whether you get to take it apart and see what makes it tick or whether you have to, you know, be nice to it and. And whatever. Right. Like, all the. All the criteria that we have now and, you know, that people are using and as you said, a lot of people are down on the Turing test and things like that. This. But what else have we got? Because measuring cortex size isn't going to cut it in the broader scheme of things. So I think it's a wide open problem. Our solution to the problem of other minds. It's very simplistic. We give each other credit for having minds just because we sort of. On an anatomical level, we're pretty similar. And then. So that's good enough. But how far is aggressive going to go? So I think that's really primitive. So, yeah, I think. I think it's a major unsolved problem.",

So, for example, it's possible that a conscious being is one that's able to suffer. So you start to look at pain and suffering, you can start to connect it closer to things that you can measure that in terms of. Of how they reflect themselves in behavior and problem solving and creation and attainment of goals, for example, which I think suffering is one of the. You know, life is suffering. It's one of the. One of the big aspects of the human condition. And so if consciousness is somehow a, maybe at least a catalyst for suffering, suffering, you could start to get, like, echoes of it and start. You start to see, like, the actual effects of consciousness and behavior, that it's not just about subjective experience. It's like it's really deeply integrated in the problem solving, decision making of a system. Something like this. But also, it's possible that we realize this is not a philosophical statement. Philosophers can write their book, folks. I welcome it. You know, I. I take the Turing test really seriously. I. I don't know why people really don't like it when a robot convinces you that it's intelligent. I think that's a really incredible accomplishment. And there's some deep sense in which that is intelligence. If it looks like it's intelligent, it is intelligent. And I think there's some deep aspect of a system that appears to be conscious in some deep sense. It is conscious. At least for me. We have to consider that possibility. And a system that appears to be conscious is an engineering challenge. Yeah, I don't disagree with any of that. I mean, especially intelligence, I think, is a publicly observed, observable thing. I. And I mean, you know, science fiction has dealt with this for a century or much more. Maybe this idea that when you are confronted with something that just doesn't meet any of your typical assumptions, so you can't look in the skull and say, oh, well, there's that frontal cortex. So then I guess we're good. Right. If it's. If it's, you know, so this thing lands on your front lawn and this, you know, with the little door opens and something trundles out, and it's sort of like, you know, kind of shiny and aluminum looking, and it hands you this, you know, it hands you this poem that it wrote while it was on, you know, flying over and how happy it is to meet you.

Like, all the. All the criteria that we have now and, you know, that people are using and as you said, a lot of people are down on the Turing test and things like that. This. But what else have we got? Because measuring cortex size isn't going to cut it in the broader scheme of things. So I think it's a wide open problem. Our solution to the problem of other minds. It's very simplistic. We give each other credit for having minds just because we sort of. On an anatomical level, we're pretty similar. And then. So that's good enough. But how far is aggressive going to go? So I think that's really primitive. So, yeah, I think. I think it's a major unsolved problem. It's a really challenging direction of thought to the human race that you talked about, like, embodied minds.

I Mean, yeah, the thing is, you're right, and I certainly get phone calls about people complaining about frog skin and so on. But I think we have to separate the sort of deep philosophical aspects of it versus what actually happens. So what actually happens on Earth is that people with exactly the same anatomical structure kill each other, you know, on a daily basis. Right. So I think it's clear that simply knowing that something else is equally, or maybe more cognitive or conscious than you are is not a guarantee of kind behavior. That much we know of. And so then we look at commercial farming of mammals and various other things. And so I think on a practical basis, long before we get to worrying about things like frog skills, we have to ask ourselves, why are we, what can we do about the way that we've been behaving towards creatures which we know for a fact, because of our similarities are basically just like us? You know, that's kind of a whole other social thing. But fundamentally, of course, you're absolutely right in that we are also think about this. We are on this planet in some way incredibly lucky. It's just dumb luck that we really only have, have one dominant species. It didn't have to work out that way. So you could easily imagine that there could be a planet somewhere with more than one equally or maybe near equally intelligent species, but they may not look anything like each other. Right. So there may be multiple ecosystems where there are things of similar to human like intelligence. And then you'd have all kinds of issues about how do you relate to them when they're physically not like you at all, but yet, you know, in terms of behavior and culture and whatever, it's pretty obvious that they've got as, you know, as much on the ball as you have. Or maybe imagine, imagine that there was another group of beings that was like on average, you know, 40 IQ points lower. Right. Like, we're just, we're pretty lucky in many ways. We don't really have. Even though we sort of, you know, we still act badly in many ways. But the fact is, you know, all humans are more or less in the, like in that same range.

      "transcript_text": "Yeah. I Mean, yeah, the thing is, you're right, and I certainly get phone calls about people complaining about frog skin and so on. But I think we have to separate the sort of deep philosophical aspects of it versus what actually happens. So what actually happens on Earth is that people with exactly the same anatomical structure kill each other, you know, on a daily basis. Right. So I think it's clear that simply knowing that something else is equally, or maybe more cognitive or conscious than you are is not a guarantee of kind behavior. That much we know of. And so then we look at commercial farming of mammals and various other things. And so I think on a practical basis, long before we get to worrying about things like frog skills, we have to ask ourselves, why are we, what can we do about the way that we've been behaving towards creatures which we know for a fact, because of our similarities are basically just like us? You know, that's kind of a whole other social thing. But fundamentally, of course, you're absolutely right in that we are also think about this. We are on this planet in some way incredibly lucky. It's just dumb luck that we really only have, have one dominant species. It didn't have to work out that way. So you could easily imagine that there could be a planet somewhere with more than one equally or maybe near equally intelligent species, but they may not look anything like each other. Right. So there may be multiple ecosystems where there are things of similar to human like intelligence. And then you'd have all kinds of issues about how do you relate to them when they're physically not like you at all, but yet, you know, in terms of behavior and culture and whatever, it's pretty obvious that they've got as, you know, as much on the ball as you have. Or maybe imagine, imagine that there was another group of beings that was like on average, you know, 40 IQ points lower. Right. Like, we're just, we're pretty lucky in many ways. We don't really have. Even though we sort of, you know, we still act badly in many ways. But the fact is, you know, all humans are more or less in the, like in that same range. But it's have to work out that way. Well, but I think that's part of the way life works on Earth. Maybe human civilization works is it seems like we want ourselves to be quite similar. And then within that, you know what, everybody's about the same relatively iq, intelligence, problem solving capabilities, even physical characteristics. But then we'll find some aspect of that, yeah, that's different. And that seems to be like, I mean, it's, it's really dark to say, but it seems to be the. Not even a bug, but like a feature of the early development of human civilization. You pick the other, your tribe versus the other tribe being you. War. It's a kind of evolute evolution in the space of, of memes, a space of ideas, I think, and you war with each other. So we're very good at finding the other even when the characteristics are really the same. And that's. I don't know what that. I mean, I'm sure so many of these things echo in the biological world in some way. Yeah, there's a fun experiment that I did. My, my son actually came up with this. So we, we did a biology unit together. He's a homeschool. And so we did this a couple of years ago. We did this thing where imagine you get this slime mold, right? Physarum polycephalum, and it grows on a petri dish of agar and it sort of spreads out and it's a single cell protist, but it's like this giant thing. And so you put down a piece of oat and it wants to go get the oat and it sort of grows towards the oat. So what you do is you take a razor blade and you just separate the piece of the whole culture that's growing towards the oat. You just kind of separate it. And so now think about the interesting decision making calculus for that little of piece. Piece I can go get the oat and therefore I won't have to share those nutrients with this giant mass over there. So the nutrients per unit volume is going to be amazing. So I should go eat the oat. But if I first rejoin, because Faisaram, once you cut it has the ability to join back up. If I first rejoin, then that whole calculus becomes impossible because there is no more me anymore. There's just we. And then we will go eat this thing. Right? So this interesting. You can imagine a kind of game theory where, where the number of agents isn't fixed and that it's not just cooperate or defect, but it's actually merge and whatever, right?",

You can imagine a kind of game theory where, where the number of agents isn't fixed and that it's not just cooperate or defect, but it's actually merge and whatever, right? So that computation, how does it do that? Decision making? Yeah, right. So it's really interesting. And so empirically what we found is that it tends to merge first. It tends to merge first and then the whole thing goes. But it's really interesting that calculus, like do we even have. I mean I'm not an expert in the economic game theory and I all that, but maybe there's a Cal made some sort of hyperbolic discounting or something, but maybe this idea that the actions you take not only change your payoff, but they change who or what you are and that you may not, you could take an action after which you don't exist anymore, or you are radically changed or you are merged with somebody else. As far as I know, we're still missing a formalism for even knowing how to, how to model any of that. Do you see evolution, by the way, as a process that applies here on Earth? Or is it some. Where did evolution come from? Yeah, yeah. So this thing that, from the very origin of life that took us to today. What, what, what the heck is that? I think evolution is inevitable in the sense that if you combine and basically I think one of the most useful things that was done in early computer, I guess in the 60s it started, was evolutionary computation and just showing how simple it is that if you have imperfect heredity and competition together, those two things were three things, right? So heredity, imperfect heredity and competition or selection. Those three things. And that's it. Now you're off to the races. Right? And so that can be, it's not just on Earth because it can be done in the computer, it can be done in chemical systems, it can be done in, you know, Lee Smolin says it works on, you know, cosmic scales. So I think that that kind of thing is incredibly pervasive and general. It's a general feature of life. It's interesting to think about. You know, the standard thought about this is that it's blind, right? Meaning that the intelligence of the process is zero. It's stumbling around. And I think that back in the day when the options were it's dumb like machines or it's smart like humans, then of course the scientists went in this direction because nobody wanted creationism. And so they said, okay, it's got to be like completely blind. I'm not actually sure, right. Because I think that everything is a continuum and I think that it doesn't have to be smart with foresight like us, but it doesn't have to be completely blind either. I think there may be maybe aspects of it and in particular this kind of multi scale competency might give it a little bit of look ahead maybe or a little bit of problem solving sort of baked in. But, but, but that's going to be completely different in different, in different systems. I do think, I do think it's general. I don't think it's just on Earth. I think it's a very fundamental thing.",

      "transcript_text": "I think evolution is inevitable in the sense that if you combine and basically I think one of the most useful things that was done in early computer, I guess in the 60s it started, was evolutionary computation and just showing how simple it is that if you have imperfect heredity and competition together, those two things were three things, right? So heredity, imperfect heredity and competition or selection. Those three things. And that's it. Now you're off to the races. Right? And so that can be, it's not just on Earth because it can be done in the computer, it can be done in chemical systems, it can be done in, you know, Lee Smolin says it works on, you know, cosmic scales. So I think that that kind of thing is incredibly pervasive and general. It's a general feature of life. It's interesting to think about. You know, the standard thought about this is that it's blind, right? Meaning that the intelligence of the process is zero. It's stumbling around. And I think that back in the day when the options were it's dumb like machines or it's smart like humans, then of course the scientists went in this direction because nobody wanted creationism. And so they said, okay, it's got to be like completely blind. I'm not actually sure, right. Because I think that everything is a continuum and I think that it doesn't have to be smart with foresight like us, but it doesn't have to be completely blind either. I think there may be maybe aspects of it and in particular this kind of multi scale competency might give it a little bit of look ahead maybe or a little bit of problem solving sort of baked in. But, but, but that's going to be completely different in different, in different systems. I do think, I do think it's general. I don't think it's just on Earth. I think it's a very fundamental thing. It does seem to have a kind of direction that it's taking us that's somehow perhaps is defined by the environment itself. It feels like we're headed towards something like we're playing out a script that was just like a single cell defines the entire organism. Yeah. It feels like from the origin of Earth self, it's playing out a kind of script. Yeah, it can't really go any other way. I mean so, so this is very controversial and I don't know the answer, but people have, people have argued that, that this is called sort of rewinding the tape of life. Right. And some people have argued, I think Conway Morris maybe has argued that there's a deep attractor, for example to the human kind of structure. And that if you were to rewind it again, you'd basically get more or less the same thing. And then other people have argued that no, it's incredibly sensitive to frozen accidents and that once certain stochastic decisions are made downstream, everything is going to be different. I don't know. I don't know know. We're very bad at predicting attractors in the space of complex systems, generally speaking. Right. We don't know. So may. So maybe evolution on Earth has these deep attractors that no matter what has happened, pretty much would likely to end up there. Or maybe not. I don't know. Well, it's a really difficult idea to imagine that if you ran Earth a million times, 500,000 times, you would get Hitler. Like yeah, we don't like to think like that. We think like. Because at least maybe in America you like to think that individual decisions can change the world. And if individual decisions can change the world, then surely any perturbation results in a totally different trajectory. But maybe there's a, in this competency hierarchy, it's a self correcting system system that just ultimately there's a bunch of chaos that ultimately is leading towards something like a super intelligent artificial intelligence system that answers 42. I mean there, there might be a kind of imperative for life that it's headed to. And we're too focused on our day to day life of getting coffee and snacks and having sex and, and getting a promotion at work, not to see the big imperative of life on Earth that is headed towards something.",

It's not optimizing for your happiness. I don't think necessarily it's optimizing for intelligence or fairness or any of that stuff. I'm going to find that person that emailed you, beat them up, take their place, steal everything they own and say now this is natural. This is natural. Yeah, exactly. Because. Because it comes from an old worldview where you could assume that whatever is natural, that that's probably for the best. And I think we're long out of that Garden of Eden kind of view, so I think we can do better. I think we. And we have to. Right? Natural just isn't great for a lot of life forms. What are some cool synthetic organisms that you think about, you dream about when you think about embodied mind? What do you imagine? What do you hope to build? Yeah, on a practical level, what I really hope to do is to gain enough of an understanding of the embodied intelligence of organs and tissues such that we can achieve a radically different regenerative medicine. So that we can say basically, and I think about it as in terms of like, okay, what's the goal kind of end game for this whole thing? To me the end game is something that you would call an anatomical compiler. So the idea is you would sit down in front of the computer and you would draw the body or the organ that you wanted. Not molecular details, but like, this is what I want. I want a six legged frog with a propeller on top, or I want a heart that looks like this, or I want a leg that looks like this. And what it would do if we knew what we were doing is put out, convert that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to convince them to build exactly that thing, right? I probably won't live to see it, but I think it's achievable. And I think what that if we can have that, then that is basically the solution to all of medicine except for infectious disease. So birth defects, right? Traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. If we knew how to tell cells what to build, all of those things go away. So those things go away in, and the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances are increasingly more heroic and expensive interventions of a sinking ship when you're like 90 and so on, right? All of that goes away because basically instead of trying to fix you up as you degrade, you progressively regenerate. You apply the regenerative medicine early before things degrade. So I think that'll have massive economic impact over what we're trying to do now, which is not at all, you know, sustainable. And, and that, that's what I hope, I hope that, I hope that we get so, so to me, yes, the xenobots will be doing useful things, cleaning up the environment, cleaning out, you know, your, or, you know, your joints and all that kind of stuff. But more important than that, I think we can use these synthetic systems to try to understand to, to, to develop a science of detecting and, and manipulating the goals of collective intelligences of cells specifically for regenerative medicine. And then sort of beyond that, if we sort of think further beyond that, what I hope is that kind of like what you said, all of this drives a reconsideration of how we formulate ethical norms. Because this old school, so in the olden days, what you could do is you were confronted with something new, you could tap on, on it, right? And if you heard a metallic clanging sound, you'd said, ah, fine, right. So you could conclude it was made in A factory. I could take it apart. I can do whatever. Right. If you did that and you got sort of a squishy kind of warm sensation, you'd say, ah, I need to be, you know, more or less nice to it and whatever. That's not going to be feasible. It was never really feasible, but it was good enough because we didn't have any. We didn't know any better. That needs to go. And I think that by breaking down those artificial barriers, someday we can try to build a system of ethical norms that does not rely on these completely contingent facts of our earthly history, but on something much, much deeper that really takes agency and the capacity to suffer and all that takes that seriously.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, on a practical level, what I really hope to do is to gain enough of an understanding of the embodied intelligence of organs and tissues such that we can achieve a radically different regenerative medicine. So that we can say basically, and I think about it as in terms of like, okay, what's the goal kind of end game for this whole thing? To me the end game is something that you would call an anatomical compiler. So the idea is you would sit down in front of the computer and you would draw the body or the organ that you wanted. Not molecular details, but like, this is what I want. I want a six legged frog with a propeller on top, or I want a heart that looks like this, or I want a leg that looks like this. And what it would do if we knew what we were doing is put out, convert that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to convince them to build exactly that thing, right? I probably won't live to see it, but I think it's achievable. And I think what that if we can have that, then that is basically the solution to all of medicine except for infectious disease. So birth defects, right? Traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. If we knew how to tell cells what to build, all of those things go away. So those things go away in, and the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances are increasingly more heroic and expensive interventions of a sinking ship when you're like 90 and so on, right? All of that goes away because basically instead of trying to fix you up as you degrade, you progressively regenerate. You apply the regenerative medicine early before things degrade. So I think that'll have massive economic impact over what we're trying to do now, which is not at all, you know, sustainable. And, and that, that's what I hope, I hope that, I hope that we get so, so to me, yes, the xenobots will be doing useful things, cleaning up the environment, cleaning out, you know, your, or, you know, your joints and all that kind of stuff.

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, on a practical level, what I really hope to do is to gain enough of an understanding of the embodied intelligence of organs and tissues such that we can achieve a radically different regenerative medicine. So that we can say basically, and I think about it as in terms of like, okay, what's the goal kind of end game for this whole thing? To me the end game is something that you would call an anatomical compiler. So the idea is you would sit down in front of the computer and you would draw the body or the organ that you wanted. Not molecular details, but like, this is what I want. I want a six legged frog with a propeller on top, or I want a heart that looks like this, or I want a leg that looks like this. And what it would do if we knew what we were doing is put out, convert that anatomical description into a set of stimuli that would have to be given to cells to convince them to build exactly that thing, right? I probably won't live to see it, but I think it's achievable. And I think what that if we can have that, then that is basically the solution to all of medicine except for infectious disease. So birth defects, right? Traumatic injury, cancer, aging, degenerative disease. If we knew how to tell cells what to build, all of those things go away. So those things go away in, and the positive feedback spiral of economic costs, where all of the advances are increasingly more heroic and expensive interventions of a sinking ship when you're like 90 and so on, right? All of that goes away because basically instead of trying to fix you up as you degrade, you progressively regenerate. You apply the regenerative medicine early before things degrade. So I think that'll have massive economic impact over what we're trying to do now, which is not at all, you know, sustainable. And, and that, that's what I hope, I hope that, I hope that we get so, so to me, yes, the xenobots will be doing useful things, cleaning up the environment, cleaning out, you know, your, or, you know, your joints and all that kind of stuff. But more important than that, I think we can use these synthetic systems to try to understand to, to, to develop a science of detecting and, and manipulating the goals of collective intelligences of cells specifically for regenerative medicine. And then sort of beyond that, if we sort of think further beyond that, what I hope is that kind of like what you said, all of this drives a reconsideration of how we formulate ethical norms. Because this old school, so in the olden days, what you could do is you were confronted with something new, you could tap on, on it, right? And if you heard a metallic clanging sound, you'd said, ah, fine, right. So you could conclude it was made in A factory. I could take it apart. I can do whatever. Right. If you did that and you got sort of a squishy kind of warm sensation, you'd say, ah, I need to be, you know, more or less nice to it and whatever. That's not going to be feasible. It was never really feasible, but it was good enough because we didn't have any. We didn't know any better. That needs to go. And I think that by breaking down those artificial barriers, someday we can try to build a system of ethical norms that does not rely on these completely contingent facts of our earthly history, but on something much, much deeper that really takes agency and the capacity to suffer and all that takes that seriously. The capacity to suffer. And the deep questions I would ask of a system is can I eat it? And can I have sex with it? Which is the two fundamental tests of again, the human condition. So I can basically do what Dolly does. That's in the, in. In the physical space. So print out like a 3D print. Pepe the frog with a propeller head. Propeller. Hat is the. Is the dream? Well, I want to. Yes and no. I mean, I want to get away from the 3D printing thing because that will be available for some things much earlier. I mean, we can already do bladders and ears and things like that because it's micro level control. Right. When you 3D print, you are in charge of where every cell goes. And for some things that you know, for, like this thing, they had that, I think 20 years ago or maybe earlier than that, you could do that. So. Yeah, I would like to emphasize the Dali part, where you provide a few words and it generates a painting. So here you say, I want a frog with these features. And then it would go direct a complex biological system to construct something like that. Yeah. The main magic would be, I mean, I think from looking at Dalia and so on, it looks like the first part is kind of solved. Now where you go from the words to the image, like that seems more or less solved. The next step is really hard. This is what keeps things like crispr and genomic editing and so on. That's what limits all the impacts for regenerative medicine. Because going back to, okay, this is the knee joint that I want, or this is the eye that I want. Now what genes do I edit to make that happen. Right. Going back in that direction is really hard. So instead of that, it's going to be okay. I understand how to motivate cells to build particular structures. Can I rewrite the memory of what they think they're supposed to be building such that then I can take my hands off the wheel and let them do their thing.",

Can I rewrite the memory of what they think they're supposed to be building such that then I can take my hands off the wheel and let them do their thing. So some of that is experiment, but some of that, maybe AI can help too. Just like with protein folding, this is exactly the problem that protein folding in the most simple medium tried and has solved with AlphaFold, which is how does the sequence of letters result in this three dimensional shape? And you have to, I guess it didn't solve it because you have to, to. If you say I want this shape, how do I then have a sequence of letters? Yeah, the reverse engineering step is really tricky. It is, I think where, and we're doing some of this now is to use AI to try and build actionable models of the intelligence of the cellular collectives. So try to help us, help us gain models. And we've had some success in this. So we did something like this forum for repairing birth defects of the brain in frog. We've done some of this for normalizing melanoma, where you can really start to use AI to make models of how would I impact this thing if I wanted to, given all the complexities and given all the controls that it knows how to do. So when you say regenerative medicine, so we talked about, about creating biological organisms, but if you regrow a hand, that information is already there. Right. The biological system has that information. So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works? What's the hope there? Yeah, yeah. How do you make it happen? Well, today there's a set of popular approaches. So one is 3D print. So the idea is I'm going to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I'm going to seed it with cells and then there it is. Right. So kind of direct. And then that works for certain things. You can make a bladder that way or an ear, something like that. The other idea is some sort of stem cell transplant. The idea is if we put in stem cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of neurons for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good, good for relatively simple structures. But when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think, and this may be an unpopular opinion, I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of time frame is to understand how the thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that made those cells in the beginning? Create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes and number of fingers and all that. And why is it that A salamander can keep losing theirs and keeps, keep regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same even more. So to me, kind of ultimate regenerative medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is you need them to build.",

So try to help us, help us gain models. And we've had some success in this. So we did something like this forum for repairing birth defects of the brain in frog. We've done some of this for normalizing melanoma, where you can really start to use AI to make models of how would I impact this thing if I wanted to, given all the complexities and given all the controls that it knows how to do. So when you say regenerative medicine, so we talked about, about creating biological organisms, but if you regrow a hand, that information is already there. Right. The biological system has that information. So how does regenerative medicine work today? How do you hope it works? What's the hope there? Yeah, yeah. How do you make it happen? Well, today there's a set of popular approaches. So one is 3D print. So the idea is I'm going to make a scaffold of the thing that I want. I'm going to seed it with cells and then there it is. Right. So kind of direct. And then that works for certain things. You can make a bladder that way or an ear, something like that. The other idea is some sort of stem cell transplant. The idea is if we put in stem cells with appropriate factors, we can get them to generate certain kinds of neurons for certain diseases and so on. All of those things are good, good for relatively simple structures. But when you want an eye or a hand or something else, I think, and this may be an unpopular opinion, I think the only hope we have in any reasonable kind of time frame is to understand how the thing was motivated to get made in the first place. So what is it that made those cells in the beginning? Create a particular arm with a particular set of sizes and shapes and number of fingers and all that. And why is it that A salamander can keep losing theirs and keeps, keep regrowing theirs and a planarian can do the same even more. So to me, kind of ultimate regenerative medicine was when you can tell the cells to build whatever it is you need them to build. Right. And so, so that we can all be like planaria, basically. Do you have to start at the very beginning or can you do a shortcut? I don't think growing a hand. You already got the whole organism. Yeah. So here's what we've done. We've more or less solved that in frogs. So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs as adults. And so we've shown that with a very kind of simple intervention. So what we do is there's two things. You need to have a signal that tells the cells what to do and then you need some way of delivering it. And so this has worked together with David Kaplan and I should do a disclosure here. We have a company called Morphaceuticals and spinoff where we are trying to regenerate, you know, limb regeneration. So we've solved it in the frog and we're now in trials in mice. So now we're going to, we're in mammals now and I can't say anything about how it's going, but the frog thing is solved. So what you do is after you.",

Have a little frog, Luke Skywalker with a regrowing hand. Yeah, basically. Basically, yeah, yeah. So what you do is we did, we did with legs instead of forearms. And what you do is after amputation, normally they, they don't regenerate. You put on a wearable bioreactor. So it's this thing that, that goes on and Dave Kaplan lab makes these things and inside it's a very controlled environment. There's a silk gel that carries some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs. And what you're doing is you're saying to these cells, you should regrow what normally goes here. So that whole thing is on for 24 hours, then you take it off, you don't touch the leg again. This is really important because what we're not looking for is a set of micromanagement printing or controlling the cells we want to trigger. We want to interact with it early on and then not touch it again because. Because we don't know how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows how to make a frog leg. So 24 hours, 18 months of leg growth after that without us touching it again. And after 18 months you get a pretty good leg that kind of shows this proof of concept that early on, when the cells, right after injury, when they're first making a decision about what they're going to do, you can, you can impact them. And once they've decided to make a leg, they don't need you. After that, they can, you know, do their own thing. So that's an approach that we're now taking. What about cancer suppression? That's something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these ideas help with cancer suppression? So let's go back to the beginning and ask what cancer is. So I think asking why there's cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question is why is there ever anything but cancer? So in the normal state, you have a bunch of cells that are all cooperating towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation breaks down and you've got a cell that is isolated from that electrical network that lets you remember what the big goal is, you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle. As far as now think about that border between self and world, right? Normally when all these cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network, they are all one self, right? Meaning that their goals, they have these large tissue level goals and so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that point, and so a lot of people model cancer cells as being more selfish and all that. They're not more selfish, they're equally selfish. It's just that they're selfish is smaller. Normally the self is huge. Now they got tiny little selves. Now what are the goals of tiny little selves? Well, proliferate, right, and migrate to wherever life is good. And that's metastasis. That's proliferation of metastasis. So one thing we found, and people have noticed years ago, that when cells convert to cancer, the first thing they see is they close the gap junctions. And it's a lot like, I think it's a lot like that experiment with the slime mold where until you close that gap junction, you can't even entertain the idea of leaving the collective because there is no you at that point, right? Your mind is mind melded with this whole other network. But as soon as the gap junction is closed, now the boundary between you, now the rest of the body is just outside environment to you. You're just a unicellular organism and the rest of the body's environment. So we studied this process and we worked out a way to artificially control the bioelectric state of these cells. To physically force them to remain in that network. And so then what that means is that nasty 60 mutations like KRAS and things like that, these really tough oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if you do them, but then artificially control of the bioelectrics, you greatly reduce tumorigenesis or normalize cells that had already begun to convert. Basically, they go back to being normal cells. And so this is another. Much like with the planaria, this is another way in which the bioelectric state kind of dominates what the genetic state is. So if you sequence the nucleic acids, you'll see the kras mutation. You'll say, ah, well, that's going to be a tumor. But there isn't a tumor because bioelectrically you've kept the cells connected, and they're just working on making nice skin and kidneys and whatever else. So we've started moving that to human glioblastoma cells, and we're hoping for a patient in the future, interaction with patients.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, basically. Basically, yeah, yeah. So what you do is we did, we did with legs instead of forearms. And what you do is after amputation, normally they, they don't regenerate. You put on a wearable bioreactor. So it's this thing that, that goes on and Dave Kaplan lab makes these things and inside it's a very controlled environment. There's a silk gel that carries some drugs, for example, ion channel drugs. And what you're doing is you're saying to these cells, you should regrow what normally goes here. So that whole thing is on for 24 hours, then you take it off, you don't touch the leg again. This is really important because what we're not looking for is a set of micromanagement printing or controlling the cells we want to trigger. We want to interact with it early on and then not touch it again because. Because we don't know how to make a frog leg, but the frog knows how to make a frog leg. So 24 hours, 18 months of leg growth after that without us touching it again. And after 18 months you get a pretty good leg that kind of shows this proof of concept that early on, when the cells, right after injury, when they're first making a decision about what they're going to do, you can, you can impact them. And once they've decided to make a leg, they don't need you. After that, they can, you know, do their own thing. So that's an approach that we're now taking. What about cancer suppression? That's something you mentioned earlier. How can all of these ideas help with cancer suppression? So let's go back to the beginning and ask what cancer is. So I think asking why there's cancer is the wrong question. I think the right question is why is there ever anything but cancer? So in the normal state, you have a bunch of cells that are all cooperating towards a large scale goal. If that process of cooperation breaks down and you've got a cell that is isolated from that electrical network that lets you remember what the big goal is, you revert back to your unicellular lifestyle. As far as now think about that border between self and world, right? Normally when all these cells are connected by gap junctions into an electrical network, they are all one self, right? Meaning that their goals, they have these large tissue level goals and so on. As soon as a cell is disconnected from that, the self is tiny, right? And so at that point, and so a lot of people model cancer cells as being more selfish and all that. They're not more selfish, they're equally selfish. It's just that they're selfish is smaller. Normally the self is huge. Now they got tiny little selves. Now what are the goals of tiny little selves? Well, proliferate, right, and migrate to wherever life is good. And that's metastasis. That's proliferation of metastasis. So one thing we found, and people have noticed years ago, that when cells convert to cancer, the first thing they see is they close the gap junctions. And it's a lot like, I think it's a lot like that experiment with the slime mold where until you close that gap junction, you can't even entertain the idea of leaving the collective because there is no you at that point, right? Your mind is mind melded with this whole other network. But as soon as the gap junction is closed, now the boundary between you, now the rest of the body is just outside environment to you. You're just a unicellular organism and the rest of the body's environment. So we studied this process and we worked out a way to artificially control the bioelectric state of these cells. To physically force them to remain in that network. And so then what that means is that nasty 60 mutations like KRAS and things like that, these really tough oncogenic mutations that cause tumors if you do them, but then artificially control of the bioelectrics, you greatly reduce tumorigenesis or normalize cells that had already begun to convert. Basically, they go back to being normal cells. And so this is another. Much like with the planaria, this is another way in which the bioelectric state kind of dominates what the genetic state is. So if you sequence the nucleic acids, you'll see the kras mutation. You'll say, ah, well, that's going to be a tumor. But there isn't a tumor because bioelectrically you've kept the cells connected, and they're just working on making nice skin and kidneys and whatever else. So we've started moving that to human glioblastoma cells, and we're hoping for a patient in the future, interaction with patients.",

So we've started moving that to human glioblastoma cells, and we're hoping for a patient in the future, interaction with patients. So is this one of the possible ways in which we may, quote, cure cancer? I think so, Yeah. I think so. I think the actual cure, I mean, there are other technologies, you know, immune therapy, I think it's a great technology. Chemotherapy, I don't think is a good. Is a good technology. I think we got to get. Get off of that. So chemotherapy just kills cells? Yeah, well, chemotherapy hopes to kill more of the tumor cells than of your cells. That's it. It's a fine balance. The problem is the cells are very similar because they are your cells. And so if you don't have a very tight way of distinguishing between them, then the toll that chemo takes on the rest of the body is just unbelievable. And immunotherapy tries to get the immune system to do some of the work. Exactly, yeah. I think that's potentially a very good, very good approach. If the immune system can be taught to recognize enough of the cancer cells, that's a pretty good approach. But I think our approach is in a way more fundamental because if you can keep the cells harnessed towards organ level goals as opposed to individual cell goals, then nobody will be making a tumor or metastasizing and so on. So we've been living through a pandemic. What do you think about viruses in this full, beautiful biological context we've been talking about? Are they beautiful to you? Are they terrifying also? Maybe, let's say, are they. Since we've been discriminating this whole conversation. Are they living? Are they embodied minds? Embodied minds that are assholes. As far as I know. And I haven't been able to find this paper again, but somewhere I saw in the last couple of months there was some paper showing an example of a virus that actually had physiology. So there was something was going on, I think proton flux or something on the virus itself. But, but barring that, generally speaking, viruses are very passive. They don't do anything by themselves. And so I don't see any particular reason to attribute much of a mind to them. I think, you know, they represent a way to hijack other minds for sure, like, like cells and, and other things.",

      "transcript_text": "Exactly, yeah. I think that's potentially a very good, very good approach. If the immune system can be taught to recognize enough of the cancer cells, that's a pretty good approach. But I think our approach is in a way more fundamental because if you can keep the cells harnessed towards organ level goals as opposed to individual cell goals, then nobody will be making a tumor or metastasizing and so on. So we've been living through a pandemic. What do you think about viruses in this full, beautiful biological context we've been talking about? Are they beautiful to you? Are they terrifying also? Maybe, let's say, are they. Since we've been discriminating this whole conversation. Are they living? Are they embodied minds? Embodied minds that are assholes. As far as I know. And I haven't been able to find this paper again, but somewhere I saw in the last couple of months there was some paper showing an example of a virus that actually had physiology. So there was something was going on, I think proton flux or something on the virus itself. But, but barring that, generally speaking, viruses are very passive. They don't do anything by themselves. And so I don't see any particular reason to attribute much of a mind to them. I think, you know, they represent a way to hijack other minds for sure, like, like cells and, and other things. But that's an interesting interplay though, if they're hijacking other minds. You know, the way we're, we were talking about living organisms that they can interact with each other and have it alter each other's trajectory by having interacted. I mean there, that's, that's a deep meaningful connection between a virus and a cell. And I think both are transformed by the experience. And so in that sense both are living. Living. Yeah, yeah. You know, the whole category, this question of what's living and what's not living, I really, I'm not sure and I know there's people that work on this and I want to, I don't want to piss anybody off, but I have not found that particularly useful as to try and make that a binary kind of distinction. I think level of cognition is very interesting as a continuum, but living and non living, I really know what to do with that. I don't know what you do next after making that distinction. That's why I make the very binary distinction. Can I have sex with it or not? Can I eat it or not? Because those are actionable, right? Yeah. Well, I think that's a critical point that you brought up because how you relate to something is really what this is all about. Right. As an engineer, how do I control it? But maybe I shouldn't be controlling it. Maybe I should be. Can I have a relationship with it? Should I be listening to its advice? Like, like all the way from, you know, I need to take it apart all the way to I better do what it says because it seems to be pretty smart and everything in between. Right. That's really what we're asking about. Yeah, we need to understand our relation to it. We're searching for that relationship even in the most trivial senses. You came up with a lot of interesting terms. We've mentioned some of the them agent show material. That's a really interesting one. That's a really interesting one for the future. Of computation and artificial intelligence and computer science and all of that. There's also. Let me go through some of them if they spark some interesting thought for you. There's teleophobia, the unwarranted fear of erring on the side of too much agency when considering a new system. Yeah, I mean that's the opposite.

I think the whole notion of anthropomorphizing is a holdover from a pre scientific age where humans were magic and everything else wasn't magic and you were anthropomorphizing when you dared suggest that something else has some features of humans. And I think we need to be way beyond that. And this issue of anthropomorphizing I think is a cheap charge. I don't think it holds any water at all other than when somebody makes a cognitive claim. I think all cognitive claims are engineering claims really. So when somebody says this thing knows, or this thing hopes, or this thing wants, or this thing predicts, all you can say is fabulous. Give me the engineering protocol that you've derived using that hypothesis. This is. And we will see if this thing helps us or not. And then we can make a rational decision. I also like anatomical compiler, A future system representing the long term endgame of the science of morphogenesis that reminds us how far away from true understanding we are. Someday you will be able to sit in front of an anatomical computer, specify the shape of the animal or plant that you want, and it will convert that shape, shape specification to a set of stimuli that will have to be given to cells to build exactly that shape. No matter how weird it ends up being, you have total control. Just imagine the possibility for memes in the physical space. One of the glorious accomplishments of human civilizations is memes in digital space. Now this could create memes in. In physical space. I am both excited and terrified by that possibility. Cognitive light cone. I think we also talked about the outer boundary in space and time of the largest goal a given system can work towards. Is this kind of like shaping the set of options?",

      "transcript_text": "This will get some people ticked off, I think, but I don't think. I think the whole notion of anthropomorphizing is a holdover from a pre scientific age where humans were magic and everything else wasn't magic and you were anthropomorphizing when you dared suggest that something else has some features of humans. And I think we need to be way beyond that. And this issue of anthropomorphizing I think is a cheap charge. I don't think it holds any water at all other than when somebody makes a cognitive claim. I think all cognitive claims are engineering claims really. So when somebody says this thing knows, or this thing hopes, or this thing wants, or this thing predicts, all you can say is fabulous. Give me the engineering protocol that you've derived using that hypothesis. This is. And we will see if this thing helps us or not. And then we can make a rational decision. I also like anatomical compiler, A future system representing the long term endgame of the science of morphogenesis that reminds us how far away from true understanding we are. Someday you will be able to sit in front of an anatomical computer, specify the shape of the animal or plant that you want, and it will convert that shape, shape specification to a set of stimuli that will have to be given to cells to build exactly that shape. No matter how weird it ends up being, you have total control. Just imagine the possibility for memes in the physical space. One of the glorious accomplishments of human civilizations is memes in digital space. Now this could create memes in. In physical space. I am both excited and terrified by that possibility. Cognitive light cone. I think we also talked about the outer boundary in space and time of the largest goal a given system can work towards. Is this kind of like shaping the set of options? It's a little different than options it's really focused on. So back in this. I first came up with this back in 2018. I want to say. Say we had a. There was a conference, a Templeton conference where they challenged us to come up with frameworks. I think actually it's the. Here it's the diverse intelligence community. That summer institute. Yeah, they had a summer institute. But the logo, it's a bee with some circuits. Yeah, it's got different life forms and you know, so the whole program is called Diverse Intelligence. And they challenged us to come up with a framework that was suitable for analyzing different kinds of intelligence together. Right. Because the kinds of things you do to a human are not good with an octopus, not good with a plant and so on. So I started thinking about this and I asked myself, what do all cognitive agents, no matter what their provenance, no matter what their architecture is, what do cognitive agents have in common? And it seems to me that what they have in common is some degree of competency to pursue a goal. And so what you can do then is you can draw. And so what I ended up drawing was this thing, thing that it's kind of like a, like a backwards Minkowski cone diagram where all of space is collapsed into one axis and then, and then here, and then time is this axis. And then what you can do is you can draw for any creature. You can, you can semi quantitatively estimate what are the, what are the spatial and temporal goals that it can, that it's capable of pursuing. So for example, if you are a tick and all you can, all you really are able to pursue is maxima or bacteria, maximizing the level of some chemical in your vicinity, that's all you've got. It's a tiny little light cone. Then you're a simple system like a tick or a bacterium. If you are something like a dog, well, you've got some ability to care about some spatial region, some temporal. You can remember a little bit backwards, you can predict a little bit forwards, but you're never ever going to care about what happens in the next town over four weeks from now. It just, it's just as far as we know, it's just impossible for that kind of architecture. If you're a human, you might be working towards world peace long after you're dead, right? So you might have a planetary scale goal that's enormous, right? And then there may be other greater intelligences somewhere that can care in the linear range about numbers of creatures that some sort of Buddha like character that can care about everybody's welfare, like really care the way that we can't. And so, and so that it's not a mapping of what you can sense, how far you can sense, right? It's not a mapping of where, how far you can act. It's a mapping of how big are the goals you are capable of envisioning. And working towards. And I think that enables you to put synthetic kinds of constructs, AIs, aliens, swarms, whatever, on the same diagram. Because we're not talking about what you're made of or how you got here. We're talking about, about what are the, what are the, the, the, the size and complexity of the goals towards which you can work.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, it's got different life forms and you know, so the whole program is called Diverse Intelligence. And they challenged us to come up with a framework that was suitable for analyzing different kinds of intelligence together. Right. Because the kinds of things you do to a human are not good with an octopus, not good with a plant and so on. So I started thinking about this and I asked myself, what do all cognitive agents, no matter what their provenance, no matter what their architecture is, what do cognitive agents have in common? And it seems to me that what they have in common is some degree of competency to pursue a goal. And so what you can do then is you can draw. And so what I ended up drawing was this thing, thing that it's kind of like a, like a backwards Minkowski cone diagram where all of space is collapsed into one axis and then, and then here, and then time is this axis. And then what you can do is you can draw for any creature. You can, you can semi quantitatively estimate what are the, what are the spatial and temporal goals that it can, that it's capable of pursuing. So for example, if you are a tick and all you can, all you really are able to pursue is maxima or bacteria, maximizing the level of some chemical in your vicinity, that's all you've got. It's a tiny little light cone. Then you're a simple system like a tick or a bacterium. If you are something like a dog, well, you've got some ability to care about some spatial region, some temporal. You can remember a little bit backwards, you can predict a little bit forwards, but you're never ever going to care about what happens in the next town over four weeks from now. It just, it's just as far as we know, it's just impossible for that kind of architecture. If you're a human, you might be working towards world peace long after you're dead, right? So you might have a planetary scale goal that's enormous, right? And then there may be other greater intelligences somewhere that can care in the linear range about numbers of creatures that some sort of Buddha like character that can care about everybody's welfare, like really care the way that we can't. And so, and so that it's not a mapping of what you can sense, how far you can sense, right? It's not a mapping of where, how far you can act. It's a mapping of how big are the goals you are capable of envisioning. And working towards. And I think that enables you to put synthetic kinds of constructs, AIs, aliens, swarms, whatever, on the same diagram. Because we're not talking about what you're made of or how you got here. We're talking about, about what are the, what are the, the, the, the size and complexity of the goals towards which you can work. Is there any other terms that pop into mind that are interesting? I'm trying to remember. There's a, I have a list of them somewhere on my website. Target morphology. Yeah, people definitely check it out more. I like that one. Ionaceutical. Yeah, yeah. I mean those, those, those refer to different types of interventions in the regenerative medicines space. So a morphaceutical is something that, it's a kind of intervention that really targets the cell's decision making process about what they're going to build. And ionaceuticals are like that, but more focused specifically on the bioelectrics. I mean there's also of course biochemical, biomechanical, who knows what else, you know, maybe optical kinds of signaling systems there as well. Target morphology is interesting. It really, it's designed to capture this idea that it's not just feed forward emergence. And oftentimes in biology, I mean, of course that happens too, but in many cases in biology, the system is specifically working towards a target in anatomical amorphous space. Right. It's a navigation task really. These kind of problem solving can be formalized as navigation tasks and that they're really going towards a particular region. How do you know? Because you deviate them and then they go back. Let me ask you, because you've. Really. Challenged a lot of ideas in biology in, in the work you do. Probably because some of your rebelliousness comes from the fact that you came from a different field of computer engineering. But could you give advice to young people today in high school or college that are trying to pave their life story, whether it's in science or elsewhere, how they can have a career they can be proud of or a life they can be proud of. Advice. Boy, it's dangerous to give advice because things change so fast. But one central thing I can say, moving up and through academia and whatnot, you will be surrounded by really smart people. And what you need to do is be very careful at distinguishing specific critique versus kind of meta advice. And what I mean by that is if somebody really smart and successful and obviously competent is giving you specific critiques on what you've done, that's gold. That's an opportunity to hone your craft, to get better at what you're doing, to learn to find your mistakes. That's great. If they are telling you what you ought to be studying, how you ought to approach things, what is the right way to think about the things, you should probably ignore most of that. And the reason I make that distinction is that a lot of really, really successful people are very well calibrated on their own ideas, in their own field, in their own sort of area. And they know exactly what works and what doesn't and what's good and what's bad, but they're not calibrated on your ideas. And so the things they will say, oh, this is a dumb idea to own. Two do this and you shouldn't do that. That stuff is generally worse than useless. It can be very demoralizing and really limiting. So what I say to people is, read very broadly, work really hard, know what you're talking about, take all specific criticism as an opportunity to improve what you're doing, and then completely ignore everything else. Because I just tell you from my own experience and most of what I consider to be interesting and useful things that we've done, very smart people have said, this is a terrible idea. Don't, don't, don't do that. Don't, you know, just. Yeah, I think we just don't know. We have no idea beyond our own. Like, at best, we know what we ought to be doing. We very rarely know what anybody else should be doing.",

And what you need to do is be very careful at distinguishing specific critique versus kind of meta advice. And what I mean by that is if somebody really smart and successful and obviously competent is giving you specific critiques on what you've done, that's gold. That's an opportunity to hone your craft, to get better at what you're doing, to learn to find your mistakes. That's great. If they are telling you what you ought to be studying, how you ought to approach things, what is the right way to think about the things, you should probably ignore most of that. And the reason I make that distinction is that a lot of really, really successful people are very well calibrated on their own ideas, in their own field, in their own sort of area. And they know exactly what works and what doesn't and what's good and what's bad, but they're not calibrated on your ideas. And so the things they will say, oh, this is a dumb idea to own. Two do this and you shouldn't do that. That stuff is generally worse than useless. It can be very demoralizing and really limiting. So what I say to people is, read very broadly, work really hard, know what you're talking about, take all specific criticism as an opportunity to improve what you're doing, and then completely ignore everything else. Because I just tell you from my own experience and most of what I consider to be interesting and useful things that we've done, very smart people have said, this is a terrible idea. Don't, don't, don't do that. Don't, you know, just. Yeah, I think we just don't know. We have no idea beyond our own. Like, at best, we know what we ought to be doing. We very rarely know what anybody else should be doing. Yeah. And their ideas, their perspective has been also calibrated not just on their field and specific situation, but also on a state of that field at a particular time in the past. So there's not many people in this world that are able to achieve revolutionary success multiple times in their life. So whenever you say somebody very smart, usually what that means is somebody who's smart who achieved a success at certain point in their life. And people often get stuck in that place where they found success. To be constantly challenging your worldview is a very difficult thing. So, yeah, also, at the same time, probably if a lot of people tell. That's the weird thing about life. If a lot of people tell you that something is stupid or is not going to work, that either means it's stupid, it's not going to work, or it's actually a great opportunity to do something new. You and you don't know which one it is. And it's probably equally likely to be either. If not, well, I don't know. The probabilities. Depends how lucky you are. Depends how brilliant you are, but you don't know. And so you can't take that advice as actual data.",

So you mentioned planaria being in some sense immortal. What's the role of death in life? What's the role of death in this whole process we have? Is it. When you look at biological systems, is death an important feature, especially as you climb up the hierarchy of competency? Boy, that's an interesting question. I think that it's certainly a factor that promotes change and turnover and an opportunity to do something different the next time for a larger scale system. So apoptosis, it's really interesting. I mean, death is really interesting in a number of ways. One is like, you could think about what was the first thing to die? That's an interesting question. What was the first creature that you could say, actually die? It's a tough thing because we don't have a great definition for it. So if you bring a cabbage home and you put it in your fridge, at what point are you going to say it's died? So it's kind of hard to know. There's also. There's one paper in which I talk about this idea that. I mean, think about this. Imagine that you have a creature that's aquatic. Let's say it's a frog or something, or a tadpole, and the animal dies in the pond. It dies for whatever reason, most of the cells are still alive. So you could imagine that if when it died, there was some sort of breakdown of the kind of activity between the cells, a bunch of cells crawled off, they could have a life as amoebas. Some of them could join together and become a xenobot and toodle around, right? So we know from planaria that there are cells that don't obey the Hayflick limit and just sort of live, live forever. So you could imagine an organism that when the organism dies, it doesn't disappear. Rather, the individual cells that are still alive crawl off and have a completely different kind of lifestyle and maybe come back together as something else. Or maybe they, they don't. So all of this, I'm sure is happening somewhere on some planet. So death in any case, I mean, we already kind of knew this because the molecules, we know that when something dies, the molecules go through the ecosystem, but even the cells don't necessarily die at that point. They might have another life in a different way. And you can think about something like HeLa, right, the HeLa cell line, you know, that has this, that's had this incredible life. There are way more HeLa cells now than there ever been, than there than there were when, when she was alive.",

      "transcript_text": "Boy, that's an interesting question. I think that it's certainly a factor that promotes change and turnover and an opportunity to do something different the next time for a larger scale system. So apoptosis, it's really interesting. I mean, death is really interesting in a number of ways. One is like, you could think about what was the first thing to die? That's an interesting question. What was the first creature that you could say, actually die? It's a tough thing because we don't have a great definition for it. So if you bring a cabbage home and you put it in your fridge, at what point are you going to say it's died? So it's kind of hard to know. There's also. There's one paper in which I talk about this idea that. I mean, think about this. Imagine that you have a creature that's aquatic. Let's say it's a frog or something, or a tadpole, and the animal dies in the pond. It dies for whatever reason, most of the cells are still alive. So you could imagine that if when it died, there was some sort of breakdown of the kind of activity between the cells, a bunch of cells crawled off, they could have a life as amoebas. Some of them could join together and become a xenobot and toodle around, right? So we know from planaria that there are cells that don't obey the Hayflick limit and just sort of live, live forever. So you could imagine an organism that when the organism dies, it doesn't disappear. Rather, the individual cells that are still alive crawl off and have a completely different kind of lifestyle and maybe come back together as something else. Or maybe they, they don't. So all of this, I'm sure is happening somewhere on some planet. So death in any case, I mean, we already kind of knew this because the molecules, we know that when something dies, the molecules go through the ecosystem, but even the cells don't necessarily die at that point. They might have another life in a different way. And you can think about something like HeLa, right, the HeLa cell line, you know, that has this, that's had this incredible life. There are way more HeLa cells now than there ever been, than there than there were when, when she was alive. It seems like as the organism become more and more complex, like if you look at the mammals, their relationship with death becomes more and more complex. So the survival imperative starts becoming interesting. And humans are arguably the first species that have invented the fear of death. The understanding that you're going to die, let's put it this way, like a long. So not like instinctual, like I need to run away from the thing that's going to eat me, but starting to contemplate the finiteness of life. Yeah, I mean, one thing, so, so one thing about the human light cognitive light cone is that for the first, as far as we know, for the first time you might have goals that are longer than your lifespan that are not achievable. Right. So if you're, if you are, let's say, and I don't know if this is true, but if you're a goldfish and you have a 10 minute attention Spanish and I'm not sure if that's true, but let's say, let's say there's some organism with a short kind of cognitive light cone. That way all of your goals are potentially achievable because you're probably going to live the next 10 minutes. So whatever goals you have, they are totally achievable. If you're a human, you could have all kinds of goals that are guaranteed, not achievable because they just take too long, like guaranteed you're not going to achieve them. So I wonder if, is that a perennial sort of thorn in our psychology that drives some, some psychosis or whatever? I have no idea. Another interesting thing about that actually And I've been thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks, this notion of giving up. So you would think that evolutionarily the most adaptive way of being is that you go, you fight as long as you physically can, and then when you can't, you can't. And there's this photograph, there's videos you can find of insects crawling around where most of it is already gone and it's still sort of crawling like Terminator style. Right. As long as you physically can, you keep going. Mammals don't do that. So a lot of mammals, including rats, have this thing where when they think it's a hopeless situation, they literally give up and die when physically they could have kept going. I mean, humans certainly do this and there's some really unpleasant experiments, experiments that this guy, I forget his name, did with drowning rats, where rats normally drown after a couple of minutes. But if you teach them that if you just tread water for a couple of minutes, you'll get rescued, they can tread water for like an hour, and so they literally just give up and die. And so evolutionarily, that doesn't seem like a good strategy at all. Evolutionarily seems. Why would you. Like, what's the benefit ever of giving up? You just do what you can and one time out of a thousand you'll actually get rescued. But this issue of actually giving up suggests some very interesting metacognitive control controls where you've now gotten to the point where survival actually isn't the top drive. And that for whatever, you know, there are other considerations that have, like, taken over. And I, I think that's uniquely a mammalian thing, but I don't know.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, I mean, one thing, so, so one thing about the human light cognitive light cone is that for the first, as far as we know, for the first time you might have goals that are longer than your lifespan that are not achievable. Right. So if you're, if you are, let's say, and I don't know if this is true, but if you're a goldfish and you have a 10 minute attention Spanish and I'm not sure if that's true, but let's say, let's say there's some organism with a short kind of cognitive light cone. That way all of your goals are potentially achievable because you're probably going to live the next 10 minutes. So whatever goals you have, they are totally achievable. If you're a human, you could have all kinds of goals that are guaranteed, not achievable because they just take too long, like guaranteed you're not going to achieve them. So I wonder if, is that a perennial sort of thorn in our psychology that drives some, some psychosis or whatever? I have no idea. Another interesting thing about that actually And I've been thinking about this a lot in the last couple of weeks, this notion of giving up. So you would think that evolutionarily the most adaptive way of being is that you go, you fight as long as you physically can, and then when you can't, you can't. And there's this photograph, there's videos you can find of insects crawling around where most of it is already gone and it's still sort of crawling like Terminator style. Right. As long as you physically can, you keep going. Mammals don't do that. So a lot of mammals, including rats, have this thing where when they think it's a hopeless situation, they literally give up and die when physically they could have kept going. I mean, humans certainly do this and there's some really unpleasant experiments, experiments that this guy, I forget his name, did with drowning rats, where rats normally drown after a couple of minutes. But if you teach them that if you just tread water for a couple of minutes, you'll get rescued, they can tread water for like an hour, and so they literally just give up and die. And so evolutionarily, that doesn't seem like a good strategy at all. Evolutionarily seems. Why would you. Like, what's the benefit ever of giving up? You just do what you can and one time out of a thousand you'll actually get rescued. But this issue of actually giving up suggests some very interesting metacognitive control controls where you've now gotten to the point where survival actually isn't the top drive. And that for whatever, you know, there are other considerations that have, like, taken over. And I, I think that's uniquely a mammalian thing, but I don't know. Yeah, the camus, the existentialist question of why live? Just the fact that humans commit suicide is a really fascinating question from an evolutionary perspective. And what was the first. And that's the other thing, thing like what is the simplest system, whether whether evolved or natural or whatever, that is able to do that. Right. Like you can think, you know, what other animals are actually able to do that. I'm not sure, maybe you could see animals over time for some reason, lowering the value of survive at all costs gradually until other objectives might become more important. Maybe, I don't know how evolutionarily how that, how that gets off the ground. That just seems like that would have such a strong pressure against it.

But it's tough because on the face of it, if that was your genome, it wouldn't get propagated because you would die and then your neighbor who didn't have that would, would have all the kids. It feels like there could be some deep truth there that we're not understanding. Yeah, maybe. What about you yourself as one biological system? Are you afraid of death? To be honest, I'm more concerned with, especially now getting older and having helped a couple of people pass, I think about. What's a good way to go. Basically, like nowadays, I don't know what that is. Sitting in a facility that sort of tries to, to stretch you out as long as you can, that doesn't seem good. And there's not a lot of opportunities to sort of, I don't know, sacrifice yourself for something useful. Right. There's not terribly many opportunities for that in modern society. So I don't know. That's more of. I'm not particularly worried about death itself, but I've seen it happen and it's not pretty and I don't know what, what a better, what a better alternative is. So the existential aspect of it does not worry you deeply the fact that this ride ends. No, it began. I mean the ride began. Right.

      "transcript_text": "To be honest, I'm more concerned with, especially now getting older and having helped a couple of people pass, I think about. What's a good way to go. Basically, like nowadays, I don't know what that is. Sitting in a facility that sort of tries to, to stretch you out as long as you can, that doesn't seem good. And there's not a lot of opportunities to sort of, I don't know, sacrifice yourself for something useful. Right. There's not terribly many opportunities for that in modern society. So I don't know. That's more of. I'm not particularly worried about death itself, but I've seen it happen and it's not pretty and I don't know what, what a better, what a better alternative is. So the existential aspect of it does not worry you deeply the fact that this ride ends. No, it began. I mean the ride began. Right. So there was, I don't know how many billions of years before that I wasn't around. So that's okay. But isn't the experience of life, it's almost like. Feels like you're immortal because the way you make plans, the way you think about the future, I mean if, if you re. If you look at your own personal, rich experience. Yes, you can understand, okay, eventually I die. There's people I love that have died, so surely I will die. And it hurts and so on, but like it sure doesn't. It's so easy to get lost in feeling like this is going to go on forever. Yeah. It's a little bit like the people who say they don't believe in free will. Right. I mean you can say that, but. But when you go to a restaurant, you still have to pick a soup and stuff, so. Right. So I don't know if I know. I've actually seen that happen at lunch with a well known philosopher and he wouldn't believe in Free will. And the waitress came around and he was like, well, let me see. I was like, what are you doing? You're gonna choose a sandwich, right? So I think it's one of those things. I think you can know that you're not going to live forever, but it's not practical to live that way unless. So you buy insurance and you do some stuff like that. But, but, but mostly, you know, I think you just. You just live as if. As if. As if you can make plans. We talked about all kinds of life. We talked about all kinds of embodied minds. What do you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of all the biological lies we've been talking about here on Earth? Why are we here? I don't know that that's a. That that's a well posed question, other than the existential question you posed before. Is that question hanging out with the question of what is consciousness? And they're at a retreat somewhere, not sure, because sipping pina coladas and because they're ambiguously defined, maybe. I'm not sure that any of these things really ride on the correctness of our scientific understanding. But I mean, just for an example, right, I've always found it weird that people get really worked up to find out realities about their bodies, for example, right? You've seen them ex machina, right? And so there's this great scene where he's cutting his hand to find out he's full of cock. Now, to me, right, If I open up and I find out a bunch of cogs, my conclusion is not, oh, crap, I must not have true cognition. That sucks. My conclusion is, wow, cogs can have true cognition. Great. So it seems to me, I guess I'm with Descartes on this one, that whatever the truth ends up being of what is consciousness, how it can be conscious, none of that is going to alter my primary experience, which is, this is what it is. And if a bottom bunch of molecular networks can do it, fantastic. If it turns out that there's a non corporeal soul, great, we'll study that, Whatever. But the fundamental existential aspect of it is if somebody told me today that you were created yesterday and all your memories are sort of fake, kind of like Boltzmann brains, right? And human skepticism, all that. Yeah. Okay, well, so, so, but, but here I am now. So. So let's.",

Like it jumps really quickly to not science as a mechanism, as, as a, as a process, but more like science of today. Like, you could just look at human history and throughout human history, just physicists and everybody would claim we've solved everything. Sure, sure. Like there's a few small things to figure out.

It's, it's really tricky to know how to intellectually deal with the thing that science doesn't currently understand. Right. So like, the thing is, if you believe that science solves everything, you can too easily in your mind think our current understanding, like we've solved everything. Right, right, right. Like it jumps really quickly to not science as a mechanism, as, as a, as a process, but more like science of today. Like, you could just look at human history and throughout human history, just physicists and everybody would claim we've solved everything. Sure, sure. Like there's a few small things to figure out. And we basically solved everything where in reality, I think asking, like, what is the meaning of life? Life is resetting the pallet. Yeah. Of like, we might be tiny and confused and don't have anything figured out. It's almost going to be hilarious a few centuries from now when they look back how dumb we were. Yeah, I 100% agree. So, so when I say science and nothing else. I certainly don't mean the science of today because I think, think overall, I think we know very little. I think most of the things that we're sure of now are going to be, as you said, are going to look hilarious down the line. So I think we're just at the beginning of a lot of really important things. When I say nothing but science, I also include the kind of first person, what I call science that you do. So the interesting thing about, I think about consciousness and studying consciousness and things like that in the first person person is unlike doing science in the third person, where you as the scientist are minimally changed by it, maybe not at all. So when I do an experiment, I'm still me. There's the experiment. Whatever I've done, I've learned something. So that's a small change. But overall, that's it. In order to really study consciousness, you are part of the experiment. You will be altered by that experiment. Right? Whatever it is that you're doing, whether it's some sort of contemplative practice or some sort of psychoactive whatever, you are now your own experiment. And you are right. And so I fold that in. I think that's part of it. I think that exploring our own mind and our own consciousness is very important. I think much of it is not captured by what currently is third person science, for sure. But ultimately I include all of that in science with a capital S. In terms of a rational investigation of both first and third person and aspects of. Our world, we are our own experiment, as beautifully put. And when two systems get to interact with each other, that's a kind of experiment.

What do I do now? I just learned that I'm full of cogs and gears, therefore I'm not what I thought I was. And I think this is a really unfortunate way to think. The bottom line is you are still the amazing integrated being with potential and a responsibility to do things. I think we are actually a collection of interacting perspectives and interacting consciousnesses. Professor Michael Levin, welcome. What's one of the biggest myths in biology that you, with your research, with your lab, is helping overturn? Yeah. Hey, Kurt, Great to see you again. I think that one of the biggest myths in biology is that the best explanations come at the level of molecules. So this, this biochemistry, what they call, you know, molecular mechanism, is usually currently taken to be the kind of the gold standard of what we're for in terms of explanations. And I think in some cases that's valuable, that has the most value, but in most cases, I think it's not the right level. And Dennis Noble has a really interesting set of papers and talks on biological relativity. So this idea that different levels of explanation, especially in biology, provide the most bang for the buck. And I think in terms of looking forward as to what do these explanations let you do as a next step, I think we really need go beyond the molecular level for many of these things. What's the difference between weak emergence and strong emergence? I think that emergence in general is basically just a measure of surprise for the observer. So I think a phenomenon is considered emergent by us if whatever it's doing was something that we didn't anticipate. And so it's relative. I don't think emergence is an absolute thing that either is there or isn't or is weak or strong. It's just a measure of the amount of surprise. How much extra is the system doing that you, knowing the rules and the very various properties of its parts, didn't see coming? That's. That's emergence, I think. Would you say, then that biology has physics fundamentally? So it goes biology, chemistry, physics. I mean, people have certainly made that, that kind of ladder. I'm not sure what we can do with that. I think that it's more like these different levels have their own types of concepts that are useful for understanding what's going on, and they have their own autonomy. That's really important that I think it's there' There's a lot of utility in considering how some of these higher levels are autonomous and they do things that the lower levels don't do, and that gives us power, that gives us experimental power. And would you say that there's something that the lower levels don't do in principle or in practice? So, for instance, is there something that a cell is doing that in principle can't be derived from the underlying chemistry, which in principle can't be derived from the underlying physics?",

So, for instance, is there something that a cell is doing that in principle can't be derived from the underlying chemistry, which in principle can't be derived from the underlying physics? Yeah, it really depends on what you mean by derive. But, for example, there are certainly aspects of, let's say, cognitive functions that we normally associate with fairly complex creatures, brains and so on, that we are now seeing in very simple basal media. So even something as simple as a gene regulatory network can have six different kinds of learning and memory, for example, Pavlovian conditioning. And so there, what you would see is on the one hand you say, okay, well, look, here's a simple bit of chemistry that's actually doing these complex things that we normally associate with behavior science and with investigating cognitive systems. You can always tell a chemistry story about any effect. In fact, you could also tell a physics story as well. If you look under the hood, all you ever find is chemistry and physics, right? But the more interesting thing about that story is that you actually can use paradigms from behavioral science, such as learning and conditioning and communication and active inference and things like that. And that lets you do way more than if you were to restrict yourself to an understanding at the level of mechanism. What's super interesting there is that you said you could always tell a chemistry story, or you could always tell a physics story to explain some biological process, but you can't always tell a biological story to something that's physics related. So what people would consider more fundamental or what gives rise to the rest in terms of ontology would be, well, can you tell a story in terms of so and so? So can you tell a story in terms of biology, of physics? Can you tell a story of. Well, you could tell a story of architecture for these buildings behind us, maybe even of biology, because people comprise the people who made this. And you could tell a mathematical story, but it would be difficult to make the case that you could tell an architectural story in the way that we understand architecture, not a metaphor about mathematics. Do you agree with that or do you disagree with that? I think that's somewhat true, although it's not as true as we think. So oftentimes you actually can tell an interesting story cashed out in the terms of behavioral science, for example, active inference, for example, various learning modalities of objects that are really thought to be the domain of physics and chemistry. So I think there's more of that than we tend to understand as of now. But it is also the case that the fact that you can tell a physics story doesn't mean that there's that much value in it necessarily. So, for example, imagine that there's a chess game going on. So you could absolutely tell the story of that chess game in terms of particle movements or maybe quantum foam or I don't know, whatever the bottom level is. So you can do that. How much does that help you in playing the next game of chess? Almost not at all. Right. If your goal is to understand what happened at the physical level, yes, you can tell a story about all the atoms that were pushing and pulling and all of that. But if your goal is to understand the large scale rules of the game of chess, the principles, and more importantly, to play the next game of chess better than what you just witness, that story is almost completely useless to you. And this abounds in biology, where you can use chemistry and physics to tell a story looking backwards about what just happened and why. But in terms of understanding what it means and developing that into a new research direction, new biomedicine, new discoveries, it often means that you actually have to tell a much larger scale story about memories, about goals, about preferences and these other kinds of concepts.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, it really depends on what you mean by derive. But, for example, there are certainly aspects of, let's say, cognitive functions that we normally associate with fairly complex creatures, brains and so on, that we are now seeing in very simple basal media. So even something as simple as a gene regulatory network can have six different kinds of learning and memory, for example, Pavlovian conditioning. And so there, what you would see is on the one hand you say, okay, well, look, here's a simple bit of chemistry that's actually doing these complex things that we normally associate with behavior science and with investigating cognitive systems. You can always tell a chemistry story about any effect. In fact, you could also tell a physics story as well. If you look under the hood, all you ever find is chemistry and physics, right? But the more interesting thing about that story is that you actually can use paradigms from behavioral science, such as learning and conditioning and communication and active inference and things like that. And that lets you do way more than if you were to restrict yourself to an understanding at the level of mechanism. What's super interesting there is that you said you could always tell a chemistry story, or you could always tell a physics story to explain some biological process, but you can't always tell a biological story to something that's physics related. So what people would consider more fundamental or what gives rise to the rest in terms of ontology would be, well, can you tell a story in terms of so and so? So can you tell a story in terms of biology, of physics? Can you tell a story of. Well, you could tell a story of architecture for these buildings behind us, maybe even of biology, because people comprise the people who made this. And you could tell a mathematical story, but it would be difficult to make the case that you could tell an architectural story in the way that we understand architecture, not a metaphor about mathematics. Do you agree with that or do you disagree with that? I think that's somewhat true, although it's not as true as we think. So oftentimes you actually can tell an interesting story cashed out in the terms of behavioral science, for example, active inference, for example, various learning modalities of objects that are really thought to be the domain of physics and chemistry. So I think there's more of that than we tend to understand as of now. But it is also the case that the fact that you can tell a physics story doesn't mean that there's that much value in it necessarily. So, for example, imagine that there's a chess game going on. So you could absolutely tell the story of that chess game in terms of particle movements or maybe quantum foam or I don't know, whatever the bottom level is. So you can do that. How much does that help you in playing the next game of chess? Almost not at all. Right. If your goal is to understand what happened at the physical level, yes, you can tell a story about all the atoms that were pushing and pulling and all of that. But if your goal is to understand the large scale rules of the game of chess, the principles, and more importantly, to play the next game of chess better than what you just witness, that story is almost completely useless to you. And this abounds in biology, where you can use chemistry and physics to tell a story looking backwards about what just happened and why. But in terms of understanding what it means and developing that into a new research direction, new biomedicine, new discoveries, it often means that you actually have to tell a much larger scale story about memories, about goals, about preferences and these other kinds of concepts. What would be the analogy here for. So the rules of chess, what are you trying to understand? The rules of what? Biology, developmental biology, cellular biology? Well, the thing that ties all of our work together. I mean, we do a lot of different things. We do cancer biology, we do developmental biology, we do regeneration, aging, not to mention AI and some other things. What ties it all together is really an effort to understand embodied mind. So the center focus of all my work is really to understand cognition broadly in very unconscious, conventional, diverse embodiments. And in biology, what we try to understand is how life and mind intersect and what are the features that allow biological systems to have preferences, to have goals, to have intelligence, to have problem solving, clever problem solving in different spaces.",

So the center focus of all my work is really to understand cognition broadly in very unconscious, conventional, diverse embodiments. And in biology, what we try to understand is how life and mind intersect and what are the features that allow biological systems to have preferences, to have goals, to have intelligence, to have problem solving, clever problem solving in different spaces. Okay, great. Because there are a variety of different themes that your work touches on. So regeneration, cancer research, basal cognition, cross embryo, morphogenetic assistance, which is from a podcast that we did a few months ago, and that will be on screen, link in the description. There's xenobots, anthrobots. Please talk about what ties that all together. Yeah, what ties it all together is the effort to understand intelligence. All of those things are really different ways that intelligence is embodied in the physical world. And so, for example, when we made xenobots and anthrobots, our goal with all of these kinds of synthetic constructs is to understand where the goals of novel systems come from. So typically, when you have a natural plant or animal and it's doing various things, not only the structure and the behavior of that organism, but also whatever goals it may have, we typically think of are driven by evolutionary past. So these are set by the evolutionary history, by adaptation to the environment. So for eons, everything that wasn't quite good at pursuing those goals died out. And then this is what you have. That's the standard story. So the reason that we make these synthetic constructs is to ask, okay, well, for creatures that never existed before, that do not have an evolutionary history of selection, where do their goals come from? So that's just part of that research program to understand where do the properties of novel cognitive systems come from that do not have a long history of selection as that system? Everything else that we do is an extension of our search for intelligence. So basically, cancer, the way we think about cancer is as the size of the cognitive light cone or of cognitive systems. What I mean by that is every agent can be defined by the size of the largest goal it can pursue. So that's the cognitive light cone in space and time. What are the biggest goals that it can pursue? If you think about individual cells, they have really humble single cell scale goals, they have metabolic goals, they have proliferative goals and things that they handle the situation on a very small single cell kind of scale. But during embryonic development and during evolution in general, policies for interaction between these cells were developed that allow them to scale the cognitive light cone. So groups of cells, for example, the groups of cells that are involved in making a salamander limb, they have this incredibly grandiose goal in a different space. Instead of metabolic space, they are building something in anatomical space. So they have a particular path that they want to take in the space of possible anatom anatomical shapes. So when a salamander loses their limb, the cells can tell that they've been pulled away from the correct region of anatomical space. They work really hard, they rebuild, they take that journey again, they rebuild that limb, and then they stop. And they stop because they know they've gotten to where they need to go. That whole thing is a navigational task, right? And there's some degree of intelligent problem solving that they can use in taking that task. So that amazing scale up of the cognitive light cone, the light cone Measures, what do you care about? So you, if you're a bacterium, maybe you care about the local sugar concentration and a couple of other things, but that's basically it. If you're a set of salamander cells, what you really care about is your position in anatomical space. Do we have the right number of fingers? Is everything the right size? And so on. And so understanding that scaling of cognition, the scaling of goals, how does a collective intelligence work that takes the little tiny, very competent tiny components that have little, tiny light cones, and how do they come together to form a. A very large cognitive that actually projects into a different space, anatomical space. Now, instead of metabolic space, though, that's fundamentally a question of intelligence. And the other thing about it is that this kind of thinking. So this is really important, that this kind of thinking is not just sort of philosophical embellishment because it leads directly to biomedical research programs. If you have this kind of idea, what you can ask is, well, let's see then, if cancer is that type of phenomenon, it's a breakdown of that scaling and that basically individual cells just shrink their lycome back down to the level of a primitive microbial cell as they were once. And that boundary between self and world now shrinks. Whereas before the boundary was that whole limb. Now the boundary is just every cell is the self. So from that perspective, they're not more selfish. They just have smaller selves. So that's really important because a lot of work in cancer models cancer cell behavior from a perspective of game theory. Like, they're less cooperative and they're more selfish. Actually, I'm not sure that's true at all. I think they just have smaller selves. And so.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, what ties it all together is the effort to understand intelligence. All of those things are really different ways that intelligence is embodied in the physical world. And so, for example, when we made xenobots and anthrobots, our goal with all of these kinds of synthetic constructs is to understand where the goals of novel systems come from. So typically, when you have a natural plant or animal and it's doing various things, not only the structure and the behavior of that organism, but also whatever goals it may have, we typically think of are driven by evolutionary past. So these are set by the evolutionary history, by adaptation to the environment. So for eons, everything that wasn't quite good at pursuing those goals died out. And then this is what you have. That's the standard story. So the reason that we make these synthetic constructs is to ask, okay, well, for creatures that never existed before, that do not have an evolutionary history of selection, where do their goals come from? So that's just part of that research program to understand where do the properties of novel cognitive systems come from that do not have a long history of selection as that system? Everything else that we do is an extension of our search for intelligence. So basically, cancer, the way we think about cancer is as the size of the cognitive light cone or of cognitive systems. What I mean by that is every agent can be defined by the size of the largest goal it can pursue. So that's the cognitive light cone in space and time. What are the biggest goals that it can pursue? If you think about individual cells, they have really humble single cell scale goals, they have metabolic goals, they have proliferative goals and things that they handle the situation on a very small single cell kind of scale. But during embryonic development and during evolution in general, policies for interaction between these cells were developed that allow them to scale the cognitive light cone. So groups of cells, for example, the groups of cells that are involved in making a salamander limb, they have this incredibly grandiose goal in a different space. Instead of metabolic space, they are building something in anatomical space. So they have a particular path that they want to take in the space of possible anatom anatomical shapes. So when a salamander loses their limb, the cells can tell that they've been pulled away from the correct region of anatomical space. They work really hard, they rebuild, they take that journey again, they rebuild that limb, and then they stop. And they stop because they know they've gotten to where they need to go. That whole thing is a navigational task, right? And there's some degree of intelligent problem solving that they can use in taking that task. So that amazing scale up of the cognitive light cone, the light cone Measures, what do you care about? So you, if you're a bacterium, maybe you care about the local sugar concentration and a couple of other things, but that's basically it. If you're a set of salamander cells, what you really care about is your position in anatomical space. Do we have the right number of fingers? Is everything the right size? And so on. And so understanding that scaling of cognition, the scaling of goals, how does a collective intelligence work that takes the little tiny, very competent tiny components that have little, tiny light cones, and how do they come together to form a. A very large cognitive that actually projects into a different space, anatomical space. Now, instead of metabolic space, though, that's fundamentally a question of intelligence. And the other thing about it is that this kind of thinking. So this is really important, that this kind of thinking is not just sort of philosophical embellishment because it leads directly to biomedical research programs. If you have this kind of idea, what you can ask is, well, let's see then, if cancer is that type of phenomenon, it's a breakdown of that scaling and that basically individual cells just shrink their lycome back down to the level of a primitive microbial cell as they were once. And that boundary between self and world now shrinks. Whereas before the boundary was that whole limb. Now the boundary is just every cell is the self. So from that perspective, they're not more selfish. They just have smaller selves. So that's really important because a lot of work in cancer models cancer cell behavior from a perspective of game theory. Like, they're less cooperative and they're more selfish. Actually, I'm not sure that's true at all. I think they just have smaller selves. And so.",

So you think you would say that every organism is equally as selfish, it just depends on their concept of self? Yeah, I think. I think all agents are. One of the things agents do is operate. It's not the only thing they do, but one of the things they do is they operate in their self interest. But the size of that self can grow and shrink. So individual cells, when they're tied into these large networks, they'll be using electrical cues, chemical cues, biomechanical cues. They're tied into these larger networks that partially erase their individuality. And we could talk about how I think that happens. But what you end up with is a collective intelligence that has a much bigger cognitive light cone. The goals are much bigger. And then, of course, you can scale that up. I mean, humans have enormous cognitive light cones, and whatever's beyond that. But that's the thing. It's the size of your cognitive light cone that determines what kinds of goals you can pursue and what space you pursue them in. So we talk about goals and we talk about intelligence. And you said something interesting, which is that life is the embodiment of intelligence or something akin to that, the embodiment of intelligence. So it's as if there's intelligence somewhere, and then you pull from it and you instantiate intelligence. So is that the way that you think of it? Let me be clear about. About what I mean.

      "transcript_text": "So just a moment. So you think you would say that every organism is equally as selfish, it just depends on their concept of self? Yeah, I think. I think all agents are. One of the things agents do is operate. It's not the only thing they do, but one of the things they do is they operate in their self interest. But the size of that self can grow and shrink. So individual cells, when they're tied into these large networks, they'll be using electrical cues, chemical cues, biomechanical cues. They're tied into these larger networks that partially erase their individuality. And we could talk about how I think that happens. But what you end up with is a collective intelligence that has a much bigger cognitive light cone. The goals are much bigger. And then, of course, you can scale that up. I mean, humans have enormous cognitive light cones, and whatever's beyond that. But that's the thing. It's the size of your cognitive light cone that determines what kinds of goals you can pursue and what space you pursue them in. So we talk about goals and we talk about intelligence. And you said something interesting, which is that life is the embodiment of intelligence or something akin to that, the embodiment of intelligence. So it's as if there's intelligence somewhere, and then you pull from it and you instantiate intelligence. So is that the way that you think of it? Let me be clear about. About what I mean. In philosophy, there's this concept of universals. So Plato had the forms. Yeah. And then would say that this is almost rectangular. So it's embodying the. The. The rectangularness, which is somehow somewhere out there, akin to what I imagine you meant when you said intelligence is there being embodied by this. But then there's Aristotle, which says, okay, yes, there is something akin to a form. It's just not out there. It's actually in here. The rectangularness is a property of this microphone. So I imagine this latter view is the one that most biologists would take. Not that there's intelligence out there. Let's just. Just grab it and instantiate it here. No, something is. Has the property of intelligence. So explain what you mean when you say embodying intelligence and also what you mean by intelligence. Yeah, let's see. And just a quick thing to finish real quick the previous thought, which is that the reason I think this stuff is not. These are not questions of philosophy. These are very practical questions of science because they lead to specific actionable technology. So the idea that what's going on in cancer is a shrinking of the cognitive light cone leads directly to a research program where you say, well, instead of killing these cells with chemotoxic chemotherapies, because I believe that they're genetically irrevocably damaged, maybe what we can do is force them into better electrical networks with their neighbors. And that's exactly what we've done. And so we've had lots of success expressing strong human oncogenes in frog embryo cells and then leaving the oncoproteins be, but instead making sure that they're connected into tight electrical networks with their neighbors. And they normalize. They make nice skin, nice muscle, they do their normal thing instead of being metastatic. And so that kind of thing. It's very important to me that all these ideas. And so we'll talk about in a minute about platonic space and things like that. It's important to me that all of these ideas don't just remain as kind of philosophical musings, but they have to make contact with the real world. And specifically not just explaining stuff that was done before, but facilitating new advances. They have to enable new research programs that weren't possible before. That's what I think is the value of all of these deep philosophical discussions. So let's see, with respect to definition of intelligence. So I like, for practical purposes, I like William James's definition, which is some degree of the ability to reach the same goal by different means. And that is presuppose. It's an interesting definition because it presupposes that there is some problem space that the agent is working on. But it does not say you have to be a brain. It doesn't say you have to be natural versus artificial. It doesn't say any of that. It's a very cybernetic definition. What it says is that you have some amount of skill in navigating that problem space to get to where you want to go, despite interventions, despite surprise, despite various barriers in your way. How much competency do you have to achieve that? And that was his definition of intelligence. Now, I will certainly agree that that doesn't capture everything that we care about in cognition. So a focus on problem solving doesn't handle play and it doesn't handle emotions and things like that. But for the purposes of our work, I focus on the problem solving aspects of intelligence. So within that, your point about the Platonic space. So now to be clear, everything that I was saying before, I think we have very strong empirical evidence for. And so now I'm going to, in answering this question, I'm just going to talk about stuff that I'm not sure of yet and that these are ideas we don't. You know, I don't feel strongly that we've shown that any of this is true. But this is my opinion and this is where our research is going. Now. I actually think that, that the Platonic view is more correct. And I know this is not how most biologists think about things. I think that in the exact same way that mathematicians that are sympathetic to the Platonic worldview, this idea that there are in fact in some way there is a separate world in which various rules of number theory and various facts of mathematics and various properties of computation and things like that, that there's a separate space where these things live. And importantly, the ideas that, that, you know, they think that we discover those things. We don't invent them or create them. We, we discover them that, and, and that they would be true still if all the facts of the physical universe were different. They would still, you know, they would still be, be true. Right. I, I extend that idea in a couple of ways. One is, I think that what, what exists in that platonic space is not just, you know, rules of mathematics and things like that, which are in a certain sense low agency kind of objects because they just sort of sit there doing, you know, they don't do much. I actually think that there's a spectrum of that and some of the components of that platonic space have much higher agency. I think it's a space of minds as well and of different ways to be intelligent. And I think that just like when you make certain devices, you suddenly harness the rules of rules of computation, rules of mathematics that are basically free lunches. There are so many things you can build that will suddenly have properties that you didn't have to bake in. You know, you get that for free basically. Right. I think intelligence is like that. I think some of the components of that platonic space are actually minds. And sometimes what happens when you build a, when you build a particular kind of body, whether it's one that's familiar to us with a brain and so on, or really some very unfamiliar architectures, whether they be alien or synthetic or whatever. I think what you're doing is you're harnessing a pre existing intelligence that is there in the same way that you harness various laws of mathematics and computation when you build specific devices.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, let's see. And just a quick thing to finish real quick the previous thought, which is that the reason I think this stuff is not. These are not questions of philosophy. These are very practical questions of science because they lead to specific actionable technology. So the idea that what's going on in cancer is a shrinking of the cognitive light cone leads directly to a research program where you say, well, instead of killing these cells with chemotoxic chemotherapies, because I believe that they're genetically irrevocably damaged, maybe what we can do is force them into better electrical networks with their neighbors. And that's exactly what we've done. And so we've had lots of success expressing strong human oncogenes in frog embryo cells and then leaving the oncoproteins be, but instead making sure that they're connected into tight electrical networks with their neighbors. And they normalize. They make nice skin, nice muscle, they do their normal thing instead of being metastatic. And so that kind of thing. It's very important to me that all these ideas. And so we'll talk about in a minute about platonic space and things like that. It's important to me that all of these ideas don't just remain as kind of philosophical musings, but they have to make contact with the real world. And specifically not just explaining stuff that was done before, but facilitating new advances. They have to enable new research programs that weren't possible before. That's what I think is the value of all of these deep philosophical discussions. So let's see, with respect to definition of intelligence. So I like, for practical purposes, I like William James's definition, which is some degree of the ability to reach the same goal by different means. And that is presuppose. It's an interesting definition because it presupposes that there is some problem space that the agent is working on. But it does not say you have to be a brain. It doesn't say you have to be natural versus artificial. It doesn't say any of that. It's a very cybernetic definition. What it says is that you have some amount of skill in navigating that problem space to get to where you want to go, despite interventions, despite surprise, despite various barriers in your way. How much competency do you have to achieve that? And that was his definition of intelligence. Now, I will certainly agree that that doesn't capture everything that we care about in cognition. So a focus on problem solving doesn't handle play and it doesn't handle emotions and things like that. But for the purposes of our work, I focus on the problem solving aspects of intelligence. So within that, your point about the Platonic space. So now to be clear, everything that I was saying before, I think we have very strong empirical evidence for. And so now I'm going to, in answering this question, I'm just going to talk about stuff that I'm not sure of yet and that these are ideas we don't. You know, I don't feel strongly that we've shown that any of this is true. But this is my opinion and this is where our research is going. Now. I actually think that, that the Platonic view is more correct. And I know this is not how most biologists think about things. I think that in the exact same way that mathematicians that are sympathetic to the Platonic worldview, this idea that there are in fact in some way there is a separate world in which various rules of number theory and various facts of mathematics and various properties of computation and things like that, that there's a separate space where these things live. And importantly, the ideas that, that, you know, they think that we discover those things. We don't invent them or create them. We, we discover them that, and, and that they would be true still if all the facts of the physical universe were different. They would still, you know, they would still be, be true. Right. I, I extend that idea in a couple of ways. One is, I think that what, what exists in that platonic space is not just, you know, rules of mathematics and things like that, which are in a certain sense low agency kind of objects because they just sort of sit there doing, you know, they don't do much. I actually think that there's a spectrum of that and some of the components of that platonic space have much higher agency. I think it's a space of minds as well and of different ways to be intelligent. And I think that just like when you make certain devices, you suddenly harness the rules of rules of computation, rules of mathematics that are basically free lunches. There are so many things you can build that will suddenly have properties that you didn't have to bake in. You know, you get that for free basically. Right. I think intelligence is like that. I think some of the components of that platonic space are actually minds. And sometimes what happens when you build a, when you build a particular kind of body, whether it's one that's familiar to us with a brain and so on, or really some very unfamiliar architectures, whether they be alien or synthetic or whatever. I think what you're doing is you're harnessing a pre existing intelligence that is there in the same way that you harness various laws of mathematics and computation when you build specific devices.",

So there's the two. The river. Do you step in? It is the same river. Okay, cool. There's a through line. There's something there though. Maybe it's something like you're akin to what you were an epsilon amount of time previous and then that's the through line.

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, let's see. And just a quick thing to finish real quick the previous thought, which is that the reason I think this stuff is not. These are not questions of philosophy. These are very practical questions of science because they lead to specific actionable technology. So the idea that what's going on in cancer is a shrinking of the cognitive light cone leads directly to a research program where you say, well, instead of killing these cells with chemotoxic chemotherapies, because I believe that they're genetically irrevocably damaged, maybe what we can do is force them into better electrical networks with their neighbors. And that's exactly what we've done. And so we've had lots of success expressing strong human oncogenes in frog embryo cells and then leaving the oncoproteins be, but instead making sure that they're connected into tight electrical networks with their neighbors. And they normalize. They make nice skin, nice muscle, they do their normal thing instead of being metastatic. And so that kind of thing. It's very important to me that all these ideas. And so we'll talk about in a minute about platonic space and things like that. It's important to me that all of these ideas don't just remain as kind of philosophical musings, but they have to make contact with the real world. And specifically not just explaining stuff that was done before, but facilitating new advances. They have to enable new research programs that weren't possible before. That's what I think is the value of all of these deep philosophical discussions. So let's see, with respect to definition of intelligence. So I like, for practical purposes, I like William James's definition, which is some degree of the ability to reach the same goal by different means. And that is presuppose. It's an interesting definition because it presupposes that there is some problem space that the agent is working on. But it does not say you have to be a brain. It doesn't say you have to be natural versus artificial. It doesn't say any of that. It's a very cybernetic definition. What it says is that you have some amount of skill in navigating that problem space to get to where you want to go, despite interventions, despite surprise, despite various barriers in your way. How much competency do you have to achieve that? And that was his definition of intelligence. Now, I will certainly agree that that doesn't capture everything that we care about in cognition. So a focus on problem solving doesn't handle play and it doesn't handle emotions and things like that. But for the purposes of our work, I focus on the problem solving aspects of intelligence. So within that, your point about the Platonic space. So now to be clear, everything that I was saying before, I think we have very strong empirical evidence for. And so now I'm going to, in answering this question, I'm just going to talk about stuff that I'm not sure of yet and that these are ideas we don't. You know, I don't feel strongly that we've shown that any of this is true. But this is my opinion and this is where our research is going. Now. I actually think that, that the Platonic view is more correct. And I know this is not how most biologists think about things. I think that in the exact same way that mathematicians that are sympathetic to the Platonic worldview, this idea that there are in fact in some way there is a separate world in which various rules of number theory and various facts of mathematics and various properties of computation and things like that, that there's a separate space where these things live. And importantly, the ideas that, that, you know, they think that we discover those things. We don't invent them or create them. We, we discover them that, and, and that they would be true still if all the facts of the physical universe were different. They would still, you know, they would still be, be true. Right. I, I extend that idea in a couple of ways. One is, I think that what, what exists in that platonic space is not just, you know, rules of mathematics and things like that, which are in a certain sense low agency kind of objects because they just sort of sit there doing, you know, they don't do much. I actually think that there's a spectrum of that and some of the components of that platonic space have much higher agency. I think it's a space of minds as well and of different ways to be intelligent. And I think that just like when you make certain devices, you suddenly harness the rules of rules of computation, rules of mathematics that are basically free lunches. There are so many things you can build that will suddenly have properties that you didn't have to bake in. You know, you get that for free basically. Right. I think intelligence is like that. I think some of the components of that platonic space are actually minds. And sometimes what happens when you build a, when you build a particular kind of body, whether it's one that's familiar to us with a brain and so on, or really some very unfamiliar architectures, whether they be alien or synthetic or whatever. I think what you're doing is you're harnessing a pre existing intelligence that is there in the same way that you harness various laws of mathematics and computation when you build specific devices. Okay, well that's super interesting. So at any moment there's a mic, there's Mike 11, but there's Mike 11 at 11am Then there's Mike 11 at 11:01am and it's not clear they're the same. So there's the two. The river. Do you step in? It is the same river. Okay, cool. There's a through line. There's something there though. Maybe it's something like you're akin to what you were an epsilon amount of time previous and then that's the through line. So as long as that's true, then you can, you can draw a worm of you throughout time. Are you saying that at any slice of that there was a Michael Levin in some Michael Levin space, which is also in the minds of human space and you're picking out points somehow you're traversing this space of minds. That's, that's actually even more specific than what I was saying. I mean, that's, that's interesting. And, and I think that's that's what I was saying that in general, kinds of minds. So there are different. I don't know quite what to think about individual instances, but kinds of minds. Because that would be an extremely large space then. Well, yes, I think the space is extremely large. Possibly infinite, but in fact probably infinite. But I think what I was talking about was mainly types of different minds, types of cognitive systems. Now, for individuals, you raise a really interesting point, which is I call them selfless, which are the kind of the thin slices of experience that you call them self lit, selfless, because you have a self and then the different slices of it are the selfless. And you can look at it as kind of like that special relativity, bread loaf sliced into pieces, that kind of thing. So I think what's interesting about asking that question about the self and what is the through line is what's really important there is to pick a vantage point of an observer. Again, kind of akin to what happens in relativity. You have to ask from whose perspective. So one of the things about being a continuous self is that other observers can count on your behaviors and your properties staying more or less constant. So the reason that we identify, oh, yes, you're the same person as you were before is basically nobody cares that you have the same atoms or you don't or the cells have been replaced. What you really care about is that, that this being, I can have the same kind of relationship with them that I had before. In other words, they're consistent. I can expect the same behaviors. The things that I think they know, they still know, and so on. And so that of course, in our human lives that often breaks down. Because humans grow from being children to being adults. All their preferences change. The things that they remember and the things that they value change. In our own lives, we sometimes change. And that's a much more important change. Are you the same person? Even though if all your material components remain the same, but you changed all your beliefs, all your preferences, would you still be the same person? So I think what we mean when we say the same is not about the matter at all. It's about what kind of relationship we can still have and what do I expect from you, behavior wise and so on. And there's some really interesting. And so that's from the perspective of an external observer. Now, the latest work that I just published a couple days ago looks at what does that mean from the perspective of the agent themselves. And this idea that you don't have access to your past, which you have access to our memory engrams Traces of past experience that were deposited in your brain and possibly in your body that future you is going to have to interpret. And so that leads to a kind of scenario where you treat your own memories as messages from your past self. You know, the idea then that is that those memories have to be interpreted. You don't necessarily know what they mean right away because you're different. You're not the same as you were. Right. Especially over long periods of time. And this comes out very starkly in organisms that change radically, like caterpillars to butterfly. So memories persist from caterpillar to butterfly. But. But the actual detailed memories of the caterpillar are of absolutely no use to the butterfly. It doesn't eat the same stuff. It doesn't move in the same way. It has a completely different body, completely different brain. You can't just take the same memories. And so I think what happens in biology is that it is very comfortable. In fact, it depends on the idea that the substrate will change. You will mutate your cells, some cells will die, new cells will be born, Material goes in and out. Unlike in our computational devices, the material is not. You're not committed to the fidelity of information that we are in our computation. You are committed to the salience of that information. So you will need to take those memory traces and reinterpret them for whatever your future situation is. In the case of the butterfly, completely different. In the case of the adult human, somewhat different than your brain when you were a child. But even during adulthood, the context, your mental context, your environment, everything changes. And I think you don't really have an allegiance to what these memories meant in the past. You reinterpret them dynamically, gives a kind of view of the self, kind of a process view of the self, that what we really are is a continuous, dynamic attempt at storytelling where what you're constantly doing is interpreting your own memories in a way that makes sense about what you know, a coherent story about what you are, think what you believe about the outside world. And it's a constant process of self construction. So that, I think, is what's going on with selves.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, yes, I think the space is extremely large. Possibly infinite, but in fact probably infinite. But I think what I was talking about was mainly types of different minds, types of cognitive systems. Now, for individuals, you raise a really interesting point, which is I call them selfless, which are the kind of the thin slices of experience that you call them self lit, selfless, because you have a self and then the different slices of it are the selfless. And you can look at it as kind of like that special relativity, bread loaf sliced into pieces, that kind of thing. So I think what's interesting about asking that question about the self and what is the through line is what's really important there is to pick a vantage point of an observer. Again, kind of akin to what happens in relativity. You have to ask from whose perspective. So one of the things about being a continuous self is that other observers can count on your behaviors and your properties staying more or less constant. So the reason that we identify, oh, yes, you're the same person as you were before is basically nobody cares that you have the same atoms or you don't or the cells have been replaced. What you really care about is that, that this being, I can have the same kind of relationship with them that I had before. In other words, they're consistent. I can expect the same behaviors. The things that I think they know, they still know, and so on. And so that of course, in our human lives that often breaks down. Because humans grow from being children to being adults. All their preferences change. The things that they remember and the things that they value change. In our own lives, we sometimes change. And that's a much more important change. Are you the same person? Even though if all your material components remain the same, but you changed all your beliefs, all your preferences, would you still be the same person? So I think what we mean when we say the same is not about the matter at all. It's about what kind of relationship we can still have and what do I expect from you, behavior wise and so on. And there's some really interesting. And so that's from the perspective of an external observer. Now, the latest work that I just published a couple days ago looks at what does that mean from the perspective of the agent themselves. And this idea that you don't have access to your past, which you have access to our memory engrams Traces of past experience that were deposited in your brain and possibly in your body that future you is going to have to interpret. And so that leads to a kind of scenario where you treat your own memories as messages from your past self. You know, the idea then that is that those memories have to be interpreted. You don't necessarily know what they mean right away because you're different. You're not the same as you were. Right. Especially over long periods of time. And this comes out very starkly in organisms that change radically, like caterpillars to butterfly. So memories persist from caterpillar to butterfly. But. But the actual detailed memories of the caterpillar are of absolutely no use to the butterfly. It doesn't eat the same stuff. It doesn't move in the same way. It has a completely different body, completely different brain. You can't just take the same memories. And so I think what happens in biology is that it is very comfortable. In fact, it depends on the idea that the substrate will change. You will mutate your cells, some cells will die, new cells will be born, Material goes in and out. Unlike in our computational devices, the material is not. You're not committed to the fidelity of information that we are in our computation. You are committed to the salience of that information. So you will need to take those memory traces and reinterpret them for whatever your future situation is. In the case of the butterfly, completely different. In the case of the adult human, somewhat different than your brain when you were a child. But even during adulthood, the context, your mental context, your environment, everything changes. And I think you don't really have an allegiance to what these memories meant in the past. You reinterpret them dynamically, gives a kind of view of the self, kind of a process view of the self, that what we really are is a continuous, dynamic attempt at storytelling where what you're constantly doing is interpreting your own memories in a way that makes sense about what you know, a coherent story about what you are, think what you believe about the outside world. And it's a constant process of self construction. So that, I think, is what's going on with selves. If it's the case, then that we interpret our memories as messages from our past selves to our current selves, then can we reverse that and say that our current actions are messages to our future self? Yeah, yeah, I think. I think that's exactly right. I think that a lot of what we're doing now is going at any given moment is behavior that is going to enable or constrain your Future self, you know, you're setting the conditions in which the environment in which your future self is going to be living, including changing yourself. You know, anything you undertake as a self improvement program or conversely, you know, when people entertain intrusive or depressive thoughts, that changes your, your brain. That literally changes the way that your future self is going to be able to process information in the future. Everything you do radiates out not only as messages and a kind of niche construction, you know, where you're changing the environment in which you're going to live, in which everybody else is going to live. We are constantly doing that to ourselves and, and to others. And so that really forces a kind of thinking about your future self as kind of akin to other people's future selves. And I think that also has important ethical implications because once once that symmetry becomes apparent that your future self is not quite you and also others future selves are also not you, that suggests that the way the same reason you do things so that your future self will have a better life, you might want to apply that to others future selves. Like breaking, breaking down this idea that, and I'm certainly not the first person to say this, but breaking down the idea that you are a persistent object separate from everybody else and sort of persisting through time, breaking that down into a set of selves and what you are doing now is basically for the good of a future self. I think makes you think differently about others future selves at the same time.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, yes, I think the space is extremely large. Possibly infinite, but in fact probably infinite. But I think what I was talking about was mainly types of different minds, types of cognitive systems. Now, for individuals, you raise a really interesting point, which is I call them selfless, which are the kind of the thin slices of experience that you call them self lit, selfless, because you have a self and then the different slices of it are the selfless. And you can look at it as kind of like that special relativity, bread loaf sliced into pieces, that kind of thing. So I think what's interesting about asking that question about the self and what is the through line is what's really important there is to pick a vantage point of an observer. Again, kind of akin to what happens in relativity. You have to ask from whose perspective. So one of the things about being a continuous self is that other observers can count on your behaviors and your properties staying more or less constant. So the reason that we identify, oh, yes, you're the same person as you were before is basically nobody cares that you have the same atoms or you don't or the cells have been replaced. What you really care about is that, that this being, I can have the same kind of relationship with them that I had before. In other words, they're consistent. I can expect the same behaviors. The things that I think they know, they still know, and so on. And so that of course, in our human lives that often breaks down. Because humans grow from being children to being adults. All their preferences change. The things that they remember and the things that they value change. In our own lives, we sometimes change. And that's a much more important change. Are you the same person? Even though if all your material components remain the same, but you changed all your beliefs, all your preferences, would you still be the same person? So I think what we mean when we say the same is not about the matter at all. It's about what kind of relationship we can still have and what do I expect from you, behavior wise and so on. And there's some really interesting. And so that's from the perspective of an external observer. Now, the latest work that I just published a couple days ago looks at what does that mean from the perspective of the agent themselves. And this idea that you don't have access to your past, which you have access to our memory engrams Traces of past experience that were deposited in your brain and possibly in your body that future you is going to have to interpret. And so that leads to a kind of scenario where you treat your own memories as messages from your past self. You know, the idea then that is that those memories have to be interpreted. You don't necessarily know what they mean right away because you're different. You're not the same as you were. Right. Especially over long periods of time. And this comes out very starkly in organisms that change radically, like caterpillars to butterfly. So memories persist from caterpillar to butterfly. But. But the actual detailed memories of the caterpillar are of absolutely no use to the butterfly. It doesn't eat the same stuff. It doesn't move in the same way. It has a completely different body, completely different brain. You can't just take the same memories. And so I think what happens in biology is that it is very comfortable. In fact, it depends on the idea that the substrate will change. You will mutate your cells, some cells will die, new cells will be born, Material goes in and out. Unlike in our computational devices, the material is not. You're not committed to the fidelity of information that we are in our computation. You are committed to the salience of that information. So you will need to take those memory traces and reinterpret them for whatever your future situation is. In the case of the butterfly, completely different. In the case of the adult human, somewhat different than your brain when you were a child. But even during adulthood, the context, your mental context, your environment, everything changes. And I think you don't really have an allegiance to what these memories meant in the past. You reinterpret them dynamically, gives a kind of view of the self, kind of a process view of the self, that what we really are is a continuous, dynamic attempt at storytelling where what you're constantly doing is interpreting your own memories in a way that makes sense about what you know, a coherent story about what you are, think what you believe about the outside world. And it's a constant process of self construction. So that, I think, is what's going on with selves. If it's the case, then that we interpret our memories as messages from our past selves to our current selves, then can we reverse that and say that our current actions are messages to our future self? Yeah, yeah, I think. I think that's exactly right. I think that a lot of what we're doing now is going at any given moment is behavior that is going to enable or constrain your Future self, you know, you're setting the conditions in which the environment in which your future self is going to be living, including changing yourself. You know, anything you undertake as a self improvement program or conversely, you know, when people entertain intrusive or depressive thoughts, that changes your, your brain. That literally changes the way that your future self is going to be able to process information in the future. Everything you do radiates out not only as messages and a kind of niche construction, you know, where you're changing the environment in which you're going to live, in which everybody else is going to live. We are constantly doing that to ourselves and, and to others. And so that really forces a kind of thinking about your future self as kind of akin to other people's future selves. And I think that also has important ethical implications because once once that symmetry becomes apparent that your future self is not quite you and also others future selves are also not you, that suggests that the way the same reason you do things so that your future self will have a better life, you might want to apply that to others future selves. Like breaking, breaking down this idea that, and I'm certainly not the first person to say this, but breaking down the idea that you are a persistent object separate from everybody else and sort of persisting through time, breaking that down into a set of selves and what you are doing now is basically for the good of a future self. I think makes you think differently about others future selves at the same time. Is it as simple as the larger the cognitive light cone, the better for the organism? Well, what does better mean? I mean, I think that certainly there are extremely successful organisms that do not have a large cognitive light cone. Having having said all that, you know, the size of an organism's cognitive lycone is not obvious. We are not good at detecting them. It's a, it's an important research program to find out what any given agent cares about because it's not easily inferable from measurements directly. You have to do a lot of experiments. So assuming we even know what anything's cognitive lycome is, I think lots of organisms do perfectly well. But then what's the definition of success? So in terms of the way we think about, well, the way many people think about evolution, in terms of how many copy number, like how many of you are there, that's your success. So just persistence and expansion into the world. From that perspective, I don't think you need a particularly large cognitive like bacteria do. Great. But from other perspectives, if we Sort of ask ourselves what the point is and why do we exert all this effort to exist in the physical world and try to persist and exert effort in all the things we do in our lives. One could make an argument that a larger cognitive light cone is probably better in the sense that it allows you to generate more meaning and allows you to bring meaning to all the effort and the, you know, the suffering and the joy and the hard work and everything else. From that perspective, one would want to enlarge one's cognitive light cone. And, you know, we collaborate. Well, I collaborate with a number of people in, in this group called csas, the, the center for the Study of Apparent Selves. And we talk about this, this notion of something. For example, in Buddhism, they have this notion of a Bodhisattva vow. And it's basically a commitment to enlarge one's cognitive light cone so that over time one becomes able to have a wider area of concern or compassion. Right. It. It. You, you know, the idea is you want to, you want to work on changing yourself in a way that your ability to really care about a wider set of beings. And so from that perspective, maybe you want a larger cognitive light cone.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, what does better mean? I mean, I think that certainly there are extremely successful organisms that do not have a large cognitive light cone. Having having said all that, you know, the size of an organism's cognitive lycone is not obvious. We are not good at detecting them. It's a, it's an important research program to find out what any given agent cares about because it's not easily inferable from measurements directly. You have to do a lot of experiments. So assuming we even know what anything's cognitive lycome is, I think lots of organisms do perfectly well. But then what's the definition of success? So in terms of the way we think about, well, the way many people think about evolution, in terms of how many copy number, like how many of you are there, that's your success. So just persistence and expansion into the world. From that perspective, I don't think you need a particularly large cognitive like bacteria do. Great. But from other perspectives, if we Sort of ask ourselves what the point is and why do we exert all this effort to exist in the physical world and try to persist and exert effort in all the things we do in our lives. One could make an argument that a larger cognitive light cone is probably better in the sense that it allows you to generate more meaning and allows you to bring meaning to all the effort and the, you know, the suffering and the joy and the hard work and everything else. From that perspective, one would want to enlarge one's cognitive light cone. And, you know, we collaborate. Well, I collaborate with a number of people in, in this group called csas, the, the center for the Study of Apparent Selves. And we talk about this, this notion of something. For example, in Buddhism, they have this notion of a Bodhisattva vow. And it's basically a commitment to enlarge one's cognitive light cone so that over time one becomes able to have a wider area of concern or compassion. Right. It. It. You, you know, the idea is you want to, you want to work on changing yourself in a way that your ability to really care about a wider set of beings. And so from that perspective, maybe you want a larger cognitive light cone. Okay, so there are three notions here. So enlarging what you care about, then also enlarging what you find relevant. And then there's also increasing the amount of opportunities that you'll have in the future. So that's the adage, that's the business adage. Go through the door that will open as many doors as possible. And then the relevance one I don't think is the case, because if you find more, if you find too much relevance, you, you will also freeze because you don't know what to do. Now then there's the concern for others. So help me disembroil these three from one another. Yeah, the, the, the relevance is, is, is I think, really important. You know, one thing I often think about is like, what's the what. What's the fundamental unit that exists in the world? Is it, Is it, you know, is it genes? Is it information? Like what. What is it that's really spreading through the universe and differentially reproducing and all that? I tend to think it's perspectives. I think that what's really out there as, as a diverse, as, as a way to describe really diverse agents. I think, I think one thing they all have is a commitment to a particular perspective. So perspective in my definition is a bundle of commitments to what am I going to measure about the outside world, what am I going to pay attention to and how am I going to weave that information into some sort of model about what's going on and more importantly, what I should do next? So there are many, many different perspectives. And as you said, it's critical that every perspective has to shut out way more stuff than it lets in. Because. Right, because if you, if you. And this, this, interestingly, this gets back to your original point about the different levels of description, you know, physics and chemistry and all that. Because if you try to, if you wanted to, if you wanted to be a Laplacian demon, if you wanted to track microstates, all the particles, right, I'm just going to track. I'm going to track reality as it really is. I'm just going to watch all the particles. That's all I'm going to do. No living system can survive this way, Right, because you would be eaten before anything else happens. You would be dead. So I think that any agent that evolves under resource constraint, so, which is all of life, and it remains an interesting question, what does that mean for AIs and so on. But any agent that evolves under constraints of metabolic and time resources is going to have to coarse grain. They're going to have to not be a reductionist. They're going to have to tell stories about agents that do things as a means of compression, as a way of compressing the outside world and picking up perspective. You cannot afford to try to track everything. It's impossible. So that compression also comes back to the memory engrams issue that we were talking about. Because as your past self compresses lots of diverse experiences into a compact representation, right, Of a memory trace of what happened, that kind of learning is fundamentally compression. When you're compressing lots of data into a short, pithy generative rule or a memory that you're going to remember that you can use later. So not the exact same experiences that you had, but some compressed representation. Well, the thing about compression is that the most efficient data that's compressed really efficiently starts to look random, right? So because you've gotten rid of all the correlations and everything else, the more you compress it, the more random it looks. And you've really gotten rid of a lot of metadata that you have to. That's the point of compression. You've lost a lot of information.",

So perspective in my definition is a bundle of commitments to what am I going to measure about the outside world, what am I going to pay attention to and how am I going to weave that information into some sort of model about what's going on and more importantly, what I should do next? So there are many, many different perspectives. And as you said, it's critical that every perspective has to shut out way more stuff than it lets in. Because. Right, because if you, if you. And this, this, interestingly, this gets back to your original point about the different levels of description, you know, physics and chemistry and all that. Because if you try to, if you wanted to, if you wanted to be a Laplacian demon, if you wanted to track microstates, all the particles, right, I'm just going to track. I'm going to track reality as it really is. I'm just going to watch all the particles. That's all I'm going to do. No living system can survive this way, Right, because you would be eaten before anything else happens. You would be dead. So I think that any agent that evolves under resource constraint, so, which is all of life, and it remains an interesting question, what does that mean for AIs and so on. But any agent that evolves under constraints of metabolic and time resources is going to have to coarse grain. They're going to have to not be a reductionist. They're going to have to tell stories about agents that do things as a means of compression, as a way of compressing the outside world and picking up perspective. You cannot afford to try to track everything. It's impossible. So that compression also comes back to the memory engrams issue that we were talking about. Because as your past self compresses lots of diverse experiences into a compact representation, right, Of a memory trace of what happened, that kind of learning is fundamentally compression. When you're compressing lots of data into a short, pithy generative rule or a memory that you're going to remember that you can use later. So not the exact same experiences that you had, but some compressed representation. Well, the thing about compression is that the most efficient data that's compressed really efficiently starts to look random, right? So because you've gotten rid of all the correlations and everything else, the more you compress it, the more random it looks. And you've really gotten rid of a lot of metadata that you have to. That's the point of compression. You've lost a lot of information. Wait, why do you say that? That the more compressed it is, the more random it is? Why isn't it the opposite, that the more random it is, the more incompressible. It is that's true, because you've already compressed the hell out of it. That's why. Right? That's why it's incompressible, because you've already compressed it as much as it can. This is the issue that, for example, the SETI people, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that they come up against, because the messages that are going to be sent by truly advanced civilizations are going to look like noise to us. Because really effective compression schemes, unless you know what the decom. So you've compressed it, unless you know what the algorithm is to re inflate it, the message itself looks like noise. It doesn't look like anything because you've pulled out all of the correlations. All of the order that would have made sense to a more naive observer is now gone. And if you don't have the key to interpret it with, it just looks like noise. And so that means that if you sort of think about this, there's an architecture like a bow tie, like a bow tie kind of architecture that's important here, where you take all these experiences, you compress them down into an engram that's your memory, and then future you has to reinflate it again and figure out, okay, so what does this mean for me now? Right? It's a simple rule that I inferred. Let's say you learned an associative learning task or some kind of. You've learned something general. You've learned to count a number or something like this. So rats. I think it takes about, if I recall correctly, like 3,000 trials before they understand the number three. That's, that's distinct from any instance. So it's not like three peanuts or three, you know, sticks. It's like the number three of anything, right? So after, you know, some thousands of trials, they get it. And so now they have this, this compressed rule. They don't remember the sticks or the, or the, or the peanuts or whatever, but they, they, they remember the actual rule to, to. Right? And so that's the engram at the center of your bow tie. Well, future you has to, has to re. Inflate it. Has to, it has to uncompress it and expand. Okay, but now I'm looking at three flowers. Is, is that the same or not? How do I, how do I apply my rule to this? And I think that what's important is that you can't do that deductively because you're missing a lot of that basic information. You, you, you, you have to be creative when you interpret Your own engrams. There's a lot of creative input that has to, that has to come in to understand what it was that you were thinking at the time. And I think that that kind of a thing, I mean, we know that recall of memories actually changes the memory, right? So in neuroscience, they know this, that there's no pure non destructive reads of memories. That when you access your memory, you change it. And I think that's why, because the act of interpretation is not just a passive reading of what's there, it's actually a construction process of trying to recreate. So what does that mean for me? What does it mean now? And that's part of that, that, that process of the, of the, of the dynamic self, you know, is, is trying to figure out. I. Obviously all this is subconscious, but. But trying to figure out what your own memories mean.",

      "transcript_text": "It is that's true, because you've already compressed the hell out of it. That's why. Right? That's why it's incompressible, because you've already compressed it as much as it can. This is the issue that, for example, the SETI people, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence that they come up against, because the messages that are going to be sent by truly advanced civilizations are going to look like noise to us. Because really effective compression schemes, unless you know what the decom. So you've compressed it, unless you know what the algorithm is to re inflate it, the message itself looks like noise. It doesn't look like anything because you've pulled out all of the correlations. All of the order that would have made sense to a more naive observer is now gone. And if you don't have the key to interpret it with, it just looks like noise. And so that means that if you sort of think about this, there's an architecture like a bow tie, like a bow tie kind of architecture that's important here, where you take all these experiences, you compress them down into an engram that's your memory, and then future you has to reinflate it again and figure out, okay, so what does this mean for me now? Right? It's a simple rule that I inferred. Let's say you learned an associative learning task or some kind of. You've learned something general. You've learned to count a number or something like this. So rats. I think it takes about, if I recall correctly, like 3,000 trials before they understand the number three. That's, that's distinct from any instance. So it's not like three peanuts or three, you know, sticks. It's like the number three of anything, right? So after, you know, some thousands of trials, they get it. And so now they have this, this compressed rule. They don't remember the sticks or the, or the, or the peanuts or whatever, but they, they, they remember the actual rule to, to. Right? And so that's the engram at the center of your bow tie. Well, future you has to, has to re. Inflate it. Has to, it has to uncompress it and expand. Okay, but now I'm looking at three flowers. Is, is that the same or not? How do I, how do I apply my rule to this? And I think that what's important is that you can't do that deductively because you're missing a lot of that basic information. You, you, you, you have to be creative when you interpret Your own engrams. There's a lot of creative input that has to, that has to come in to understand what it was that you were thinking at the time. And I think that that kind of a thing, I mean, we know that recall of memories actually changes the memory, right? So in neuroscience, they know this, that there's no pure non destructive reads of memories. That when you access your memory, you change it. And I think that's why, because the act of interpretation is not just a passive reading of what's there, it's actually a construction process of trying to recreate. So what does that mean for me? What does it mean now? And that's part of that, that, that process of the, of the, of the dynamic self, you know, is, is trying to figure out. I. Obviously all this is subconscious, but. But trying to figure out what your own memories mean. Yes. Okay, so you said obviously much of this is. Or maybe you said obviously all of it, or much of it, I'm not sure is subconscious. So when we say you currently are constructing an engram for the future, you to then unpackage. I am not doing this. At least not at all a effortful conscious level. There's an instinctual unconscious component to it. And then both to the encoding and then to the retrieval and the expansion of the engram. Yeah. So who. The person who's listening to this, they listen to these podcasts, they listen to theories of everything in large part because they're trying to understand themselves. They're interested in science, they're interested in philosophy. You're also speaking to them now with this answer to this question. Who are they? They're listening to this and they're saying, I'm doing this. I don't, I'm not aware of doing. This is all news to me, Mike. You're saying I've been doing this my whole life and this defines me. This doesn't sound anything like me. So who are you? Who are you, Mike? And who is the person who's listening? What defines them? Well, so. So a few things. So the fact that there are an incredible number of processes under the hood has been known for a really long time. So. So not only all the physiological stuff that's going on, I mean, you also also don't have the experience of running your liver and your kidneys, which are very necessary for your brain function. You are also not aware of all the subconscious motivations and patterns and traits and everything else. So let's assume right now that whatever our conscious experience is, there is tons of stuff under the hood, not just the thing that I just said, but everything else that neuroscience has been studying for 100 years or more. There's lots going on under the hood. And that doesn't define you. It enables you to do certain things. It constrains you from doing certain other things that you might want to do. The hardware does not define you. I think the most important thing, and look, I think this is a really important question because I get lots of emails from people who say, I've read your papers. I understand that now. I understand I'm a collective intelligence of groups of cells. What do I do now? I, I don't know what, what to, what to do anymore. Right. And my answer is, do whatever amazing thing you were going to do before you read that paper. Like all, all of this information about what's under the hood is interesting and it's, and it's, and it's, you know, it has all kinds of implications, but the one thing it does not do is diminish your responsibility for living the best, most meaningful life you can. It, it doesn't affect any of that. And one way I think about this, and there's lots of sci fi about this, but one, one thing that you might remember is you seen the film Ex Ex Machina? Yes. And so, and so there's one scene there where the protagonist, he's standing in front of a mirror and he's completely freaked out because the AI is so lifelike. He's now wondering maybe he's a robotic organism too. And so, so he's, you know, he's, he's cutting his hand and he's looking in his eye and he's trying to figure out what he is. And so, so let's, let's just, just dissect that for a minute. The reason he's doing this and, and what happens to most people, which I think is quite interesting, is that if, if they were to open their, their arm and they find a bunch of cogs and gears inside, I think most people would be super depressed because what they would. Because I think where most people go with this is I've just learned something about myself. Meaning I know I, I know what cogs and gears can do. They're a machine. And I just learned that I'm full of cogs and gears, therefore I'm not what I thought I was. And I think this is a really unfortunate way that, a really unfortunate way to think because what you're saying is your experience of your whole life and all of the joys and the Suffering and the personal responsibility and everything else that you've experienced, you are now willing to give all that up because you think you know something about what cogs and gears can do. Do. I would go in the exact opposite direction and I would say amazing. I've just discovered that cogs and gears can do this incredible thing like, wow. And, and, and why not? Because, because why do you think that proteins and, you know, the ions and proteins and the various things in your body, those are, those are great for true cognition. I mean, like, like I always knew I was full of, you know, protein and, and, and lipids and ions and all of those things, and that was cool. I was okay with being that kind of machine. But cogs and gears, no way. Right? And so I think one thing that we get from our education focused on certain kinds of materialism is that we get this unwarranted confidence in what we think different materials are capable of and we believe it to such an extent. I mean, I find this amazing as a kind of an educational or sociological thing that we, we, we, we imbibe that story so strongly that we're willing to then give up everything that we know about ourselves in order to stick to a story about materials. I, I think, I think that's, you know, the one, one thing that I think Descartes had really, really right, is that the one thing you actually know is that you, you are an agentic being with, with responsibility and, and a mind and, and all these, you know, all this potential and, and whatever you learn is on the background of that. So if you find out that you are made of cogs and gears, all you should conclude is, well, great, now I know this stuff can do it as well as proteins can. So what I really hope that people get from this is simply the idea that pretty much no discovery about the hardware, no discovery about the biology or the physics of it should pull you away from the fundamental reality of your being, that whatever it is that you are, you know, groups of cells, an emergent, you know, an emergent mind pulled down from Platonic space or whatever, whichever of these things are correct. The bottom line is you are still the amazing integrated being with potential and a responsibility to do things. Things.",

      "transcript_text": "So who. The person who's listening to this, they listen to these podcasts, they listen to theories of everything in large part because they're trying to understand themselves. They're interested in science, they're interested in philosophy. You're also speaking to them now with this answer to this question. Who are they? They're listening to this and they're saying, I'm doing this. I don't, I'm not aware of doing. This is all news to me, Mike. You're saying I've been doing this my whole life and this defines me. This doesn't sound anything like me. So who are you? Who are you, Mike? And who is the person who's listening? What defines them? Well, so. So a few things. So the fact that there are an incredible number of processes under the hood has been known for a really long time. So. So not only all the physiological stuff that's going on, I mean, you also also don't have the experience of running your liver and your kidneys, which are very necessary for your brain function. You are also not aware of all the subconscious motivations and patterns and traits and everything else. So let's assume right now that whatever our conscious experience is, there is tons of stuff under the hood, not just the thing that I just said, but everything else that neuroscience has been studying for 100 years or more. There's lots going on under the hood. And that doesn't define you. It enables you to do certain things. It constrains you from doing certain other things that you might want to do. The hardware does not define you. I think the most important thing, and look, I think this is a really important question because I get lots of emails from people who say, I've read your papers. I understand that now. I understand I'm a collective intelligence of groups of cells. What do I do now? I, I don't know what, what to, what to do anymore. Right. And my answer is, do whatever amazing thing you were going to do before you read that paper. Like all, all of this information about what's under the hood is interesting and it's, and it's, and it's, you know, it has all kinds of implications, but the one thing it does not do is diminish your responsibility for living the best, most meaningful life you can. It, it doesn't affect any of that. And one way I think about this, and there's lots of sci fi about this, but one, one thing that you might remember is you seen the film Ex Ex Machina? Yes. And so, and so there's one scene there where the protagonist, he's standing in front of a mirror and he's completely freaked out because the AI is so lifelike. He's now wondering maybe he's a robotic organism too. And so, so he's, you know, he's, he's cutting his hand and he's looking in his eye and he's trying to figure out what he is. And so, so let's, let's just, just dissect that for a minute. The reason he's doing this and, and what happens to most people, which I think is quite interesting, is that if, if they were to open their, their arm and they find a bunch of cogs and gears inside, I think most people would be super depressed because what they would. Because I think where most people go with this is I've just learned something about myself. Meaning I know I, I know what cogs and gears can do. They're a machine. And I just learned that I'm full of cogs and gears, therefore I'm not what I thought I was. And I think this is a really unfortunate way that, a really unfortunate way to think because what you're saying is your experience of your whole life and all of the joys and the Suffering and the personal responsibility and everything else that you've experienced, you are now willing to give all that up because you think you know something about what cogs and gears can do. Do. I would go in the exact opposite direction and I would say amazing. I've just discovered that cogs and gears can do this incredible thing like, wow. And, and, and why not? Because, because why do you think that proteins and, you know, the ions and proteins and the various things in your body, those are, those are great for true cognition. I mean, like, like I always knew I was full of, you know, protein and, and, and lipids and ions and all of those things, and that was cool. I was okay with being that kind of machine. But cogs and gears, no way. Right? And so I think one thing that we get from our education focused on certain kinds of materialism is that we get this unwarranted confidence in what we think different materials are capable of and we believe it to such an extent. I mean, I find this amazing as a kind of an educational or sociological thing that we, we, we, we imbibe that story so strongly that we're willing to then give up everything that we know about ourselves in order to stick to a story about materials. I, I think, I think that's, you know, the one, one thing that I think Descartes had really, really right, is that the one thing you actually know is that you, you are an agentic being with, with responsibility and, and a mind and, and all these, you know, all this potential and, and whatever you learn is on the background of that. So if you find out that you are made of cogs and gears, all you should conclude is, well, great, now I know this stuff can do it as well as proteins can. So what I really hope that people get from this is simply the idea that pretty much no discovery about the hardware, no discovery about the biology or the physics of it should pull you away from the fundamental reality of your being, that whatever it is that you are, you know, groups of cells, an emergent, you know, an emergent mind pulled down from Platonic space or whatever, whichever of these things are correct. The bottom line is you are still the amazing integrated being with potential and a responsibility to do things. Things.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, so. So a few things. So the fact that there are an incredible number of processes under the hood has been known for a really long time. So. So not only all the physiological stuff that's going on, I mean, you also also don't have the experience of running your liver and your kidneys, which are very necessary for your brain function. You are also not aware of all the subconscious motivations and patterns and traits and everything else. So let's assume right now that whatever our conscious experience is, there is tons of stuff under the hood, not just the thing that I just said, but everything else that neuroscience has been studying for 100 years or more. There's lots going on under the hood. And that doesn't define you. It enables you to do certain things. It constrains you from doing certain other things that you might want to do. The hardware does not define you. I think the most important thing, and look, I think this is a really important question because I get lots of emails from people who say, I've read your papers. I understand that now. I understand I'm a collective intelligence of groups of cells. What do I do now? I, I don't know what, what to, what to do anymore. Right. And my answer is, do whatever amazing thing you were going to do before you read that paper. Like all, all of this information about what's under the hood is interesting and it's, and it's, and it's, you know, it has all kinds of implications, but the one thing it does not do is diminish your responsibility for living the best, most meaningful life you can. It, it doesn't affect any of that. And one way I think about this, and there's lots of sci fi about this, but one, one thing that you might remember is you seen the film Ex Ex Machina? Yes. And so, and so there's one scene there where the protagonist, he's standing in front of a mirror and he's completely freaked out because the AI is so lifelike. He's now wondering maybe he's a robotic organism too. And so, so he's, you know, he's, he's cutting his hand and he's looking in his eye and he's trying to figure out what he is. And so, so let's, let's just, just dissect that for a minute. The reason he's doing this and, and what happens to most people, which I think is quite interesting, is that if, if they were to open their, their arm and they find a bunch of cogs and gears inside, I think most people would be super depressed because what they would. Because I think where most people go with this is I've just learned something about myself. Meaning I know I, I know what cogs and gears can do. They're a machine. And I just learned that I'm full of cogs and gears, therefore I'm not what I thought I was. And I think this is a really unfortunate way that, a really unfortunate way to think because what you're saying is your experience of your whole life and all of the joys and the Suffering and the personal responsibility and everything else that you've experienced, you are now willing to give all that up because you think you know something about what cogs and gears can do. Do. I would go in the exact opposite direction and I would say amazing. I've just discovered that cogs and gears can do this incredible thing like, wow. And, and, and why not? Because, because why do you think that proteins and, you know, the ions and proteins and the various things in your body, those are, those are great for true cognition. I mean, like, like I always knew I was full of, you know, protein and, and, and lipids and ions and all of those things, and that was cool. I was okay with being that kind of machine. But cogs and gears, no way. Right? And so I think one thing that we get from our education focused on certain kinds of materialism is that we get this unwarranted confidence in what we think different materials are capable of and we believe it to such an extent. I mean, I find this amazing as a kind of an educational or sociological thing that we, we, we, we imbibe that story so strongly that we're willing to then give up everything that we know about ourselves in order to stick to a story about materials. I, I think, I think that's, you know, the one, one thing that I think Descartes had really, really right, is that the one thing you actually know is that you, you are an agentic being with, with responsibility and, and a mind and, and all these, you know, all this potential and, and whatever you learn is on the background of that. So if you find out that you are made of cogs and gears, all you should conclude is, well, great, now I know this stuff can do it as well as proteins can. So what I really hope that people get from this is simply the idea that pretty much no discovery about the hardware, no discovery about the biology or the physics of it should pull you away from the fundamental reality of your being, that whatever it is that you are, you know, groups of cells, an emergent, you know, an emergent mind pulled down from Platonic space or whatever, whichever of these things are correct. The bottom line is you are still the amazing integrated being with potential and a responsibility to do things. Things. Huh? So many people who dislike materialism and like the more whatever they consider to be not materialism, so could be idealism, it could be spiritualism or whatever they want to call it, or non dualism or trialism instead of a dualism. In part, what they're saying is, look, I'm not material because they denigrate the material and they view it as robotic, lifeless. But you're saying there's another route. If you are material, whatever it is you turn out to be, you can elevate that. So you can say, look, there's, there's a dynamism to it, there's an exuberance, there's a larger than lifeness to the. What I previously thought was ossifying. Yeah, for sure. And Ian McGilchrist makes a point of this too. He says that we've, we've underestimated matter. You know, when, when we talk about materialism, we, we have been sold and are selling still this notion of matter as lacking intelligence. And I think that we need to give up this unwarranted confidence in what we think matter can do. We are finding novel protocognitive capacities in extremely minimal systems, extremely minimal systems. And they're surprising to us, they're shocking when we find these things. And I think we are really bad at recognizing what kinds of systems can give rise to minds and therefore being depressed because we think that we are a particular kind of system. And there's no way that system can be this majestic agentic being. It's way too early for that. We absolutely, I mean, this is one of the. I think the major things is that we have this idea that we know what different kinds of matter can do, do. And obviously I'm not just talking about homogenous blocks of material, I'm talking about specific configurations. But really minimal kinds of things can have some very surprising cognitive qualities. And so, yeah, it's way too early to think that we know what's going on here.",

I think we have a record here of 45 minutes of recording or so. And we haven't mentioned the word bioelectricity once. So kudos to you. Kudos to me. How the heck did that happen for a Michael Levin interview? So what does bioelectricity have to do with any of this? Yeah, so bioelectricity is not magic. It is not unique in the sense that there are probably, certainly out in the universe, there are probably other ways of doing what it does. But what it does here on Earth in living forms is something very interesting. It functions as a kind of cognitive glue blue. So when you have collective intelligence, You need to have policies and you need to have mechanisms for enabling individual competent individuals to merge together into a larger emergent individual. That's going to do several things. First of all, the larger network, the larger level is going to, to distort the option space for the lower levels. So the parts are doing things that the parts do, but they're now doing it in a way that, that is coherent with a much higher level story of what's going on. Higher level goals, because their, their action landscape is bent, it's distorted by the larger level, their perception, their, their, you know, energy landscape is, is, is distorted. So that collective is going to, that, that new self is going to have memories, goals, preferences. Cognitive light cone that requires some very specific features and there are a bunch of them. And one of the modalities that lets that happen, that lets the cognitive light cone scale, that lets the intelligence scale, is bioelectricity. So by taking cells and enabling them to be part of an electrical network, there are some really interesting larger level dynamics which this is what we exploit in artificial neural networks, of course, but biology notice since the time of bacterial biofilms, that electricity is just a really good way for higher level selves to emerge and higher level computation to emerge. There are probably other ways of doing it, but here on Earth, bioelectricity tends to be the way to go.",

      "transcript_text": "I think we have a record here of 45 minutes of recording or so. And we haven't mentioned the word bioelectricity once. So kudos to you. Kudos to me. How the heck did that happen for a Michael Levin interview? So what does bioelectricity have to do with any of this? Yeah, so bioelectricity is not magic. It is not unique in the sense that there are probably, certainly out in the universe, there are probably other ways of doing what it does. But what it does here on Earth in living forms is something very interesting. It functions as a kind of cognitive glue blue. So when you have collective intelligence, You need to have policies and you need to have mechanisms for enabling individual competent individuals to merge together into a larger emergent individual. That's going to do several things. First of all, the larger network, the larger level is going to, to distort the option space for the lower levels. So the parts are doing things that the parts do, but they're now doing it in a way that, that is coherent with a much higher level story of what's going on. Higher level goals, because their, their action landscape is bent, it's distorted by the larger level, their perception, their, their, you know, energy landscape is, is, is distorted. So that collective is going to, that, that new self is going to have memories, goals, preferences. Cognitive light cone that requires some very specific features and there are a bunch of them. And one of the modalities that lets that happen, that lets the cognitive light cone scale, that lets the intelligence scale, is bioelectricity. So by taking cells and enabling them to be part of an electrical network, there are some really interesting larger level dynamics which this is what we exploit in artificial neural networks, of course, but biology notice since the time of bacterial biofilms, that electricity is just a really good way for higher level selves to emerge and higher level computation to emerge. There are probably other ways of doing it, but here on Earth, bioelectricity tends to be the way to go. Something I always wonder in conversations about our higher selves, lower selves, higher goals. How do we even say higher or lower when what we're talking about is such a vast landscape of goals? Or cognitive light cones in a higher dimensional space case where the real number line is the only continuum that has an ordering to it. As soon as you have the complex numbers or R2 or R3, etc. There's no. You can't pick two points and say one is higher than another unless you implement other structure. So what is it that allows us to say higher or lower? Bad vocabulary. You're 100% right. The only thing that matters here, because it doesn't necessarily mean the next level up is not necessarily smarter than the lower level usually, but, but that doesn't guarantee that at all. Not necessarily bigger or smaller in physical scale. So the only thing I mean by. And we really don't have a great vocabulary yet for all this stuff, but the only thing I mean by higher is something akin to set membership. Just the fact that a tissue is made up of cells and cells are made up of molecular networks. That's it. That's all I'm talking about. I'm not saying that it's bigger or more intelligent or more valuable. All I mean is that in this heterarchy certain things are made up of other things. That's it, that's all.",

I'm not saying that it's bigger or more intelligent or more valuable. All I mean is that in this heterarchy certain things are made up of other things. That's it, that's all. I mean, earlier when defining intelligence, I believe you said William James was Something about ability, but also means. So ability to generate multiple paths to a single goal. I don't know if it was also the ability to have multiple goals, but we can explore that. But let's pick out a goal. Then you can generate multiple paths to that goal, many ways of executing. But then you also, also, I believe you said the means too as well. Is that correct? Yeah, the, the means in, in James's, at least the way I read him in James, when he says means, he means the path. That, that is the path. A means to an end, right? It's a path that takes you to that end. So, you know, this is the kind of stuff we see in biology. Just to, you know, just to give you an example, one thing that people often think when, when they hear me talk about the intelligence of development and so on, people often think, I mean, the complexity, just the fact that you start from an egg and you end up with, I don't know, a salamander or something, that there's an increase in complexity. And then, you know, and then rightly, people think, well, that's just, you know, there's lots of examples where simple rules give. Give rise to complex outcomes that just. Emergent. Emergent complexity. That's not intelligence. And they're right. That is not what I mean. That's not intelligence. What I mean by intelligence is the problem solving of the following kinds of. Right. So let's say you have an egg belonging to a salamander. One of the tricks you can do is prevent it from dividing while the genetic material is copying. And so you end up with polyploid newts. So instead of 2N, you can have 4N, 5N, 6N, 8N, that kind of thing. Well, what happens when you do that? What happens is the cells get bigger in order to accommodate the extra genetic material. But the actual salamander stays the same size. So if you take a cross section, so let's say we take a cross section of a little tubule, a kidney tubule that runs to the kidneys. Normally there's like eight to ten little cells that go in the circle to make that tubule and then there's a lumen in the middle. So if you make the cells gigantic, the first thing you notice is that, well, first of all, having multiple copies of the genetic material, you still get a normal Newton. So that's pretty amazing already. Second, amazing thing is when the cells scale to the amount of genetic material, so the cells get larger. That's amazing. Then you find that, well, actually, since the cells are really big, big. There's only, only a few of them are now working together to make the exact same size tubule. So they scale the number of cells to make up for the aberrant size of the cell. Right, that makes sense. And then the most amazing thing of all happens. When you make truly gigantic cells, there's not even room for more than one. One cell will bend around itself, leaving a lumen in the middle. The reason that's amazing is that that requires a different molecular mechanism, that cytoskeletal bending. Whereas before you had cell to cell communication and so, so that kind of thing, right? So just think about this. You're a newt coming into the world. You have no idea. You can't count on how much genetic material you're going to have, how many cells you're going to have, what size cells you're going to have. What you do have is a bunch of cool tools at your disposal. You have cytoskeletal dynamics, you have gene regulatory networks, you have bioelectricity, you have all this stuff. And what you're able to do under totally novel circumstances is pick from your bag of tools to solve the problem. I go from an a egg to in, in morphospace, I take this journey from an egg to a proper newt. Not only can I not count on the environment being the same, I can't even count on my own parts being the same. Right, that kind of, that kind of. You know, another way to call this attitude is, is, is, is beginner's mind. It's like you don't over train on your priors, on your evolutionary priors. You have a bag of tools and you're not just a fixed solution. This is why I think evolution doesn't just, just produce solutions to specific environmental problems, it produces problem solving agents that are able to use the tools they have. I mean, what's a better example of intelligence than something that can use the tools it has in novel ways to solve a problem it's never seen before, right? Like that is a version of intelligence. And that's what is all over the place in biology. The ability to navigate these pathways, ways not only to avoid, to avoid various barriers and so on, but to use the tools available to them in creative ways to solve the problem. And we see some of this in extremely minimal systems. It does not require a brain, doesn't even require cells. Very minimal systems have surprising problem solving capacities. And this is why we should be extremely humble when we try to make claims about what something is or isn't or what competencies it has, as we are not yet good at recognizing those things. We do not have a mature science yet of knowing what, what the properties of any of this stuff is.",

It's a path that takes you to that end. So, you know, this is the kind of stuff we see in biology. Just to, you know, just to give you an example, one thing that people often think when, when they hear me talk about the intelligence of development and so on, people often think, I mean, the complexity, just the fact that you start from an egg and you end up with, I don't know, a salamander or something, that there's an increase in complexity. And then, you know, and then rightly, people think, well, that's just, you know, there's lots of examples where simple rules give. Give rise to complex outcomes that just. Emergent. Emergent complexity. That's not intelligence. And they're right. That is not what I mean. That's not intelligence. What I mean by intelligence is the problem solving of the following kinds of. Right. So let's say you have an egg belonging to a salamander. One of the tricks you can do is prevent it from dividing while the genetic material is copying. And so you end up with polyploid newts. So instead of 2N, you can have 4N, 5N, 6N, 8N, that kind of thing. Well, what happens when you do that? What happens is the cells get bigger in order to accommodate the extra genetic material. But the actual salamander stays the same size. So if you take a cross section, so let's say we take a cross section of a little tubule, a kidney tubule that runs to the kidneys. Normally there's like eight to ten little cells that go in the circle to make that tubule and then there's a lumen in the middle. So if you make the cells gigantic, the first thing you notice is that, well, first of all, having multiple copies of the genetic material, you still get a normal Newton. So that's pretty amazing already. Second, amazing thing is when the cells scale to the amount of genetic material, so the cells get larger. That's amazing. Then you find that, well, actually, since the cells are really big, big. There's only, only a few of them are now working together to make the exact same size tubule. So they scale the number of cells to make up for the aberrant size of the cell. Right, that makes sense. And then the most amazing thing of all happens. When you make truly gigantic cells, there's not even room for more than one. One cell will bend around itself, leaving a lumen in the middle. The reason that's amazing is that that requires a different molecular mechanism, that cytoskeletal bending. Whereas before you had cell to cell communication and so, so that kind of thing, right? So just think about this. You're a newt coming into the world. You have no idea. You can't count on how much genetic material you're going to have, how many cells you're going to have, what size cells you're going to have. What you do have is a bunch of cool tools at your disposal. You have cytoskeletal dynamics, you have gene regulatory networks, you have bioelectricity, you have all this stuff. And what you're able to do under totally novel circumstances is pick from your bag of tools to solve the problem. I go from an a egg to in, in morphospace, I take this journey from an egg to a proper newt. Not only can I not count on the environment being the same, I can't even count on my own parts being the same. Right, that kind of, that kind of. You know, another way to call this attitude is, is, is, is beginner's mind. It's like you don't over train on your priors, on your evolutionary priors. You have a bag of tools and you're not just a fixed solution. This is why I think evolution doesn't just, just produce solutions to specific environmental problems, it produces problem solving agents that are able to use the tools they have. I mean, what's a better example of intelligence than something that can use the tools it has in novel ways to solve a problem it's never seen before, right? Like that is a version of intelligence. And that's what is all over the place in biology. The ability to navigate these pathways, ways not only to avoid, to avoid various barriers and so on, but to use the tools available to them in creative ways to solve the problem. And we see some of this in extremely minimal systems. It does not require a brain, doesn't even require cells. Very minimal systems have surprising problem solving capacities.

We do not have a mature science yet of knowing what, what the properties of any of this stuff is. So the tricky part with this definition of intelligence, Help me out with this. Is that what we want to say is that it's conceivable that the kid from Saskatoon, the poor kid, is more intelligent than the rich kid from the Bay Area. So that's conceivable. But the rich kid has far more means, far more ability to achieve their goals. So if there was implement, implementability within the path. So if we say, look, the ability to generate paths that are realizable is in part what defines the. The IQ or the intelligence, while the poor kid from Saskatoon has less raw material to play with to generate a path path. So how do we, how do we avoid saying, unless you want to say, which I don't imagine you want to say, how do we avoid saying that the poor kid from Saskatoon is just by definition, less intelligence by, by happenstance than the person from the Bay Area? Yeah, the, the thing, the thing to keep in mind here is that estimates of intelligence and, and I think all cognitive terms. So everything about, you know, all the words that people use, sentience, cognition, goal directedness, all of them, I think we have to remember that those are not objective properties of a given system. IQ is not the property of whatever system you're trying to gauge the IQ of. It is your guess, your best guess, about what kind of problem solving you can expect out of that system. So it's as much about you as it is about the system. And we've shown this in our experiments a lot of times that when people talk about certain kinds of developmental constraints or they talk about the competency of tissues to do one thing or the other, it's much more about our own knowledge of the right stimuli and the right ways to communicate with that system, and not so much about the system itself. When you make an estimate of the intelligence of something, you are taking an IQ test yourself. All you're saying is, this is what I know in terms of, and this is what I can see in terms of what kind of problem solving I can see. And this applies to animals, this applies to AIs, this applies to humans in various economic environments. You know, the simple version of this is you show somebody a human brain and they say, that's a pretty awesome paperweight. And I can see that it can do, you know, at least action and hold down my papers against gravity. And that's All I think it can do. And somebody else says, you've missed the whole thing. Right? Like this thing does all this other stuff. So I think that type of mistake where A, we think that it's an objective property of the system and B, that we think that we're good at determining what that is, is what bites a lot when we're dealing with especially unconventional systems. So if someone, so to use your example, if someone looks at a kid with that environment and says, well, I don't think this kid has much intelligence, the problem isn't on the side of the kid. The problem is that somebody else might come along and says, oh, you don't get it. In a different environment, this kid would exhibit all these amazing behaviors. The good news about all of this, and certainly it's not in my wheelhouse to comment on any of the kind of economic stuff or, or the sociology of it, but for the, for the biology and, and, and for the computer science and so on, the good news is that all of these things are empirical, empirically testable. So when, when we come across a certain system, each of us is going to guess what is the problem space it's operating in, what are its goals and what capabilities do we think it has to reach those goals? And then we do the experiment. Experiment and then we see who's right. That's the thing that this is not a philosophical debate. This is absolutely experimental. So if you say I don't think these cells have any intelligence, you know, I think they're just a feed forward emergent dynamics. And I think, oh no, I think they're actually minimizing or maximizing some particular thing and they're clever about doing it. We do the experiment, we put a barrier in their place between them and their goals and we actually see do they or do they not have what I claimed to know to be their, their competency? And then we find out how much each of our views lets us discover the next best thing. So these are all empirically testable kinds of ideas.",

Is that what we want to say is that it's conceivable that the kid from Saskatoon, the poor kid, is more intelligent than the rich kid from the Bay Area. So that's conceivable. But the rich kid has far more means, far more ability to achieve their goals. So if there was implement, implementability within the path. So if we say, look, the ability to generate paths that are realizable is in part what defines the. The IQ or the intelligence, while the poor kid from Saskatoon has less raw material to play with to generate a path path. So how do we, how do we avoid saying, unless you want to say, which I don't imagine you want to say, how do we avoid saying that the poor kid from Saskatoon is just by definition, less intelligence by, by happenstance than the person from the Bay Area? Yeah, the, the thing, the thing to keep in mind here is that estimates of intelligence and, and I think all cognitive terms. So everything about, you know, all the words that people use, sentience, cognition, goal directedness, all of them, I think we have to remember that those are not objective properties of a given system. IQ is not the property of whatever system you're trying to gauge the IQ of. It is your guess, your best guess, about what kind of problem solving you can expect out of that system.

And we've shown this in our experiments a lot of times that when people talk about certain kinds of developmental constraints or they talk about the competency of tissues to do one thing or the other, it's much more about our own knowledge of the right stimuli and the right ways to communicate with that system, and not so much about the system itself. When you make an estimate of the intelligence of something, you are taking an IQ test yourself. All you're saying is, this is what I know in terms of, and this is what I can see in terms of what kind of problem solving I can see. And this applies to animals, this applies to AIs, this applies to humans in various economic environments. You know, the simple version of this is you show somebody a human brain and they say, that's a pretty awesome paperweight. And I can see that it can do, you know, at least action and hold down my papers against gravity. And that's All I think it can do. And somebody else says, you've missed the whole thing. Right? Like this thing does all this other stuff. So I think that type of mistake where A, we think that it's an objective property of the system and B, that we think that we're good at determining what that is, is what bites a lot when we're dealing with especially unconventional systems. So if someone, so to use your example, if someone looks at a kid with that environment and says, well, I don't think this kid has much intelligence, the problem isn't on the side of the kid. The problem is that somebody else might come along and says, oh, you don't get it. In a different environment, this kid would exhibit all these amazing behaviors. The good news about all of this, and certainly it's not in my wheelhouse to comment on any of the kind of economic stuff or, or the sociology of it, but for the, for the biology and, and, and for the computer science and so on, the good news is that all of these things are empirical, empirically testable. So when, when we come across a certain system, each of us is going to guess what is the problem space it's operating in, what are its goals and what capabilities do we think it has to reach those goals? And then we do the experiment. Experiment and then we see who's right. That's the thing that this is not a philosophical debate. This is absolutely experimental. So if you say I don't think these cells have any intelligence, you know, I think they're just a feed forward emergent dynamics. And I think, oh no, I think they're actually minimizing or maximizing some particular thing and they're clever about doing it. We do the experiment, we put a barrier in their place between them and their goals and we actually see do they or do they not have what I claimed to know to be their, their competency? And then we find out how much each of our views lets us discover the next best thing. So these are all empirically testable kinds of ideas. So before we get to consciousness and the Levin labs, I want to talk about cognition. So in 2021 or so, you had a paper called Reframing cognition. Okay, Something akin to that. Yeah, that sounds like, I think that might have been a review with Pamela Lyon. Maybe that's. Yeah. And then on page 10, section 5, something like that, you defined or you started talking about basal cognition and uncaviated cognition. So what do those terms mean? To be completely honest, I don't remember this part. I mean, I, Yes, I certainly don't remember the pages or the basal cognition. Yeah, I mean, so, okay, so, so the idea for basal cognition is basically that whatever cognitive capacities we have, they have to have an origin and we have to ask, where did they come from? Because this idea that we are completely unique and they suddenly sort of snap into place. It doesn't work evolutionarily and it doesn't work developmentally. Both of those are very slow processes. So the stories we have to tell are stories of scaling. To really understand these processes, we have to understand how simple information processing capacity these scale up to become larger cognitive light cones, more intelligent systems project into new problem spaces, and so on. So basal cognition is the question of, okay, so where did our cognitive capacities come from? So that means looking at the functional intelligence of cells, tissues, slime, molds, microbes, bacteria and minimal matter, you know, active materials, that kind of stuff. That's basal cognition. What do the really primitive versions of cognition look like? And it's a really important skill to practice that kind of imagination because often what trips people up is they imagine, for example, panpsychist views, right? So somebody says, oh, you're trying to tell me that this rock is sitting there having hopes and dreams? Well, no, that's not the claim. The claim is that, that the claim isn't that these full blown large scale cognitive properties that you have are exactly there everywhere else. The claim is that it's a spectrum or a continuum and that there are primitive tiny versions of them that are also should be recognized because we need to understand how they scale. So that's basal cognition.",

Is it electrically charged? Well, it's on the spectrum, yeah. If it has a non zero amount, you call it electrically charged. If it's zero, then you say it's neutral.

      "transcript_text": "To be completely honest, I don't remember this part. I mean, I, Yes, I certainly don't remember the pages or the basal cognition. Yeah, I mean, so, okay, so, so the idea for basal cognition is basically that whatever cognitive capacities we have, they have to have an origin and we have to ask, where did they come from? Because this idea that we are completely unique and they suddenly sort of snap into place. It doesn't work evolutionarily and it doesn't work developmentally. Both of those are very slow processes. So the stories we have to tell are stories of scaling. To really understand these processes, we have to understand how simple information processing capacity these scale up to become larger cognitive light cones, more intelligent systems project into new problem spaces, and so on. So basal cognition is the question of, okay, so where did our cognitive capacities come from? So that means looking at the functional intelligence of cells, tissues, slime, molds, microbes, bacteria and minimal matter, you know, active materials, that kind of stuff. That's basal cognition. What do the really primitive versions of cognition look like? And it's a really important skill to practice that kind of imagination because often what trips people up is they imagine, for example, panpsychist views, right? So somebody says, oh, you're trying to tell me that this rock is sitting there having hopes and dreams? Well, no, that's not the claim. The claim is that, that the claim isn't that these full blown large scale cognitive properties that you have are exactly there everywhere else. The claim is that it's a spectrum or a continuum and that there are primitive tiny versions of them that are also should be recognized because we need to understand how they scale. So that's basal cognition. So if it's a spectrum, I hear this plenty. Look, I'm not saying someone will say, I'm not saying everything is conscious, it's a spectrum, it's not on off. But then to me, can't you just define on off to be? If you have a non zero on the spectrum, then you're on. Like for instance, you don't say, you say a particle has electric charge. Is it electrically charged? Well, it's on the spectrum, yeah. If it has a non zero amount, you call it electrically charged. If it's zero, then you say it's neutral. So can't you just say then that yes, the rock does have hopes and dreams, even if it's at 0.00002% of whatever you have. Path. Well, I, I personally am, am on board with that. I, I think, you know, I think, I think potential energy and, and least action principles are the tiniest hopes and dreams that there are. I so, so I agree with that completely. I think that is the most Basil version. And in our universe. So, so I don't. This goes way beyond my pay grade. But, but for example, I've talked to Chris Fields, who, who is really an expert in this stuff, and I asked him, is it possible to have a universe without least action laws, right? And he said, the only way you can have that is if nothing ever happens. So if that's the case, that tells me that in our world there is no zero on the cognitive scale and everything is on it. But again, we have to ask then. So I agree with you. I think if you're on the spectrum, then you're on and that's it. And I think in this universe, everything is on. But we have to ask ourselves, what do we want this terminology to do for us? So that's why some people critique these kind of perspectives by saying, well then, if everything is on it, then the word means nothing. Then why do we even have the word? Because if everything is cognitive, and I didn't say consciousness yet, but let's say everything is cognitive, then why do we need the word everything is? And I really think that we need to focus on what we expect the terminology to do for us. So let's imagine, let's just dissect this for a minute. The old paradox of the heap, right? So you got, you got a pile of sand. And you know, you know that if you take off one little piece of sand, you still got a pile, but eventually you have nothing. So, so what, what, how do you define the pile? So I, I think for all of these. So, so my answer to this, and I think the solution to all of these kinds of terminological issues is that it's not about the object itself, it's about what tools you're going to use to interact with it. So if you call me and you say, I have a pile of sand hand, all I want to know about the definition of pile is am I bringing tweezers, a spoon, a shovel, a bulldozer, dynamite? How are we, like, what are the tools that I have to do what we need to get done? So that is the only value in this terminology. So by saying that everything is cognitive, does that by itself help us with anything? No, I think what does help is if you tell me what kind of cognition and how much, and that's an empirical question, and then we can argue about it. And the answer to that question is, is what are the tools that help us the most? So you show me a bunch of cells. And you say, I think the right way to do this is physics, chemistry and feed forward emergence and complexity. That's how I think we're going to interact with it. And I look at it and say, I think the way to interact with this is through some interesting concepts from cognitive neuroscience, including active inference, learning, training and so on. Then we get to find out who's right. If I can show that using my concepts, I got to new discoveries that you didn't get to. There you go. On the other hand, if I waste all my time writing poems to a rock and nothing ever comes of it, well, then you're right. And so I think that the point of all this terminology, yes, we can say it's all on a spectrum, but now comes the fun and interesting work of saying, okay, so what does the spectrum look like? And where on the spectrum do the various things that we see land?",

I want to say that I, I don't agree with Chris Fields about the principle of least action because firstly people say the universe is lazy, but you can also put a minus sign and say the principle of most of maximum effort. Okay, but then also there are many, there are many quantum field theories that aren't based in Lagrangians to minimize. So there's algebraic, constructive, axiomatic and categorical. And then there's, there's, there's this whole. There's a new video that actually got released a couple days ago by Gabriel Carcassi and I'll put the link on screen which says there's a distinction between Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. So Hamiltonian is more about flows. You just watch the flow of the system. Lagrangian is the one where you minimize. And then Newtonian. There's actually some Newtonian systems, F equals MA that you can't map to a Hamiltonian system. So I have a bone to pick with Chris Fields.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, I, I personally am, am on board with that. I, I think, you know, I think, I think potential energy and, and least action principles are the tiniest hopes and dreams that there are. I so, so I agree with that completely. I think that is the most Basil version. And in our universe. So, so I don't. This goes way beyond my pay grade. But, but for example, I've talked to Chris Fields, who, who is really an expert in this stuff, and I asked him, is it possible to have a universe without least action laws, right? And he said, the only way you can have that is if nothing ever happens. So if that's the case, that tells me that in our world there is no zero on the cognitive scale and everything is on it. But again, we have to ask then. So I agree with you. I think if you're on the spectrum, then you're on and that's it. And I think in this universe, everything is on. But we have to ask ourselves, what do we want this terminology to do for us? So that's why some people critique these kind of perspectives by saying, well then, if everything is on it, then the word means nothing. Then why do we even have the word? Because if everything is cognitive, and I didn't say consciousness yet, but let's say everything is cognitive, then why do we need the word everything is? And I really think that we need to focus on what we expect the terminology to do for us. So let's imagine, let's just dissect this for a minute. The old paradox of the heap, right? So you got, you got a pile of sand. And you know, you know that if you take off one little piece of sand, you still got a pile, but eventually you have nothing. So, so what, what, how do you define the pile? So I, I think for all of these. So, so my answer to this, and I think the solution to all of these kinds of terminological issues is that it's not about the object itself, it's about what tools you're going to use to interact with it. So if you call me and you say, I have a pile of sand hand, all I want to know about the definition of pile is am I bringing tweezers, a spoon, a shovel, a bulldozer, dynamite? How are we, like, what are the tools that I have to do what we need to get done? So that is the only value in this terminology. So by saying that everything is cognitive, does that by itself help us with anything? No, I think what does help is if you tell me what kind of cognition and how much, and that's an empirical question, and then we can argue about it. And the answer to that question is, is what are the tools that help us the most? So you show me a bunch of cells. And you say, I think the right way to do this is physics, chemistry and feed forward emergence and complexity. That's how I think we're going to interact with it. And I look at it and say, I think the way to interact with this is through some interesting concepts from cognitive neuroscience, including active inference, learning, training and so on. Then we get to find out who's right. If I can show that using my concepts, I got to new discoveries that you didn't get to. There you go. On the other hand, if I waste all my time writing poems to a rock and nothing ever comes of it, well, then you're right. And so I think that the point of all this terminology, yes, we can say it's all on a spectrum, but now comes the fun and interesting work of saying, okay, so what does the spectrum look like? And where on the spectrum do the various things that we see land? Okay, let's get to consciousness. This. I want to say that I, I don't agree with Chris Fields about the principle of least action because firstly people say the universe is lazy, but you can also put a minus sign and say the principle of most of maximum effort. Okay, but then also there are many, there are many quantum field theories that aren't based in Lagrangians to minimize. So there's algebraic, constructive, axiomatic and categorical. And then there's, there's, there's this whole. There's a new video that actually got released a couple days ago by Gabriel Carcassi and I'll put the link on screen which says there's a distinction between Newtonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. So Hamiltonian is more about flows. You just watch the flow of the system. Lagrangian is the one where you minimize. And then Newtonian. There's actually some Newtonian systems, F equals MA that you can't map to a Hamiltonian system. So I have a bone to pick with Chris Fields. You should have them on. This is, you know, this is getting way beyond anything I could argue with you about. But you should have him on and you guys could talk. I would watch that for sure. We had a three way discussion. Again, a plug here with Michael Levin, Carl Friston and Chris Fields. That was fun. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So many people want to know what is your hunch at which. See, there are various interpretations of quantum mechanics. We're not going to go there. But there are various theories of consciousness in the same way. There's litany. There's a litany. Which one do you feel like is on the right track. Well, let's see. I can say a few things. What I definitely don't have yet. I'm working on it, but I don't have anything that I would talk about now. A new theory of consciousness. So I do not have anything brilliant to add to this that somebody else hasn't already said. So I'm just going to kind of tell you what I have to say now. Sure. I think that one thing that's really hard about consciousness and what makes it the hard problem is that unlike everything else that we work with, we don't have any idea what a correct theory would output. So what format would the predictions. Sorry, we don't have an idea of what the correct theory would look like? No, no, no, no. We don't have a correct. We don't have any idea of what the output of a correct theory would look like. What would it give you? Right. So for everything else, the cor. A good theory gives you numbers, predictions about specific things that are going to happen. What does a good theory of consciousness give you? So what we would like is something that we say, okay, here's a cat or here's a cat with three extra brain hemispheres grafted on that also has wings. What is it like to be these creatures? Right. What is the output of a correct theory of consciousness? Because if it outputs puts patterns of behavior or physiological states, then what you've explained is physiology and behavior. There are going to be people that say, well, you haven't explained the consciousness at all. In fact, almost all theories of consciousness look kind of eliminativist. Even the ones that aren't trying to be. Even the ones that say, no, no, we're not trying to explain away consciousness. It's real and I'm going to explain it. Then you look at the explanation and you always feel like, yeah, but, but, but you haven't explained the actual, you know, the, the actual consciousness. You've explained some kind of behavioral propensities, physiological states or whatever. So, so that's the problem that we have. Consciousness is the one of those things that cannot exclusively be studied in the third person. Everything else you can study as an external observer. And you don't change much as the observer by, by studying them. Consciousness, you can really only, you know, in a full way. You can only study consciousness by being part of the experiment environment by, by, by seeing, by experiencing it from the, from the first person perspective. So the weak version of this is, you might say, well, a good theory of consciousness is, is a kind. Is Art, what it outputs is art, poetry, whatever. That when we experience it, it makes us experience that conscious state. And we say, oh, so that's what it's like. I see, right. So, so that's, that's one that. But that's kind of a weak form. You can do a stronger form. And you say, well, the real way to do it is to have a rich brain interface. So if I want to know what some other system is, is what its consciousness is like, we need to fuse together. Now caveat to that is you don't find out what it's. If you do that, you know, so, so let's say a rich kind of brain interface, you know, we, we really connect our brains together or something. You don't get to find out what it's like to be that system. You find, both of you find out what it's like to be a new system composed of the two of you. So it's still not. So from that perspective, it's really hard. I mean, you know, people, I suppose people who do meditation or take psychedelics, I suppose they're doing experiments in actual consciousness. But, but third person experiments in consciousness are really hard. You can do things like turn it off, you know, so there's general anesthesia and you can say, oh look, you know, the consciousness is gone. And, and even, and even then some people will say, yeah, but I experienced, you know, floating above my body while you did the surgery. And I, you know, and I saw you drop the scalpel and do this or that. So, so it's still, you know, even, even with that amazing reagent of being able to supposedly shut consciousness, you still get some issues. So the study of consciousness is hard for those kinds of reasons. And I think that about the only useful thing I could say here is that for the same reasons that we associate consciousness with brains, for exactly those same reasons, we should take very seriously the possibility of other forms of consciousness in the rest of our body studies. And, and also lots of other things. But you know, we, and so, so I'm working. So Nick Rouleau and I are working on, on a paper on this where you can sort of look at all the different popular theories of consciousness on the table and you can just ask which of them are specific for brains and why? Like what, what, what aspects of each of those theories really tells you that it's got to be brains. My guess is we haven't finished the paper yet, but my guess right now is that there's not a single one that can distinguish, distinguish brains from other, other other types of structures in your body. And so I think we should take very seriously the possibility that other subsystems of the body have some sort of consciousness. It's not verbal consciousness.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, let's see. I can say a few things. What I definitely don't have yet. I'm working on it, but I don't have anything that I would talk about now. A new theory of consciousness. So I do not have anything brilliant to add to this that somebody else hasn't already said. So I'm just going to kind of tell you what I have to say now. Sure. I think that one thing that's really hard about consciousness and what makes it the hard problem is that unlike everything else that we work with, we don't have any idea what a correct theory would output. So what format would the predictions. Sorry, we don't have an idea of what the correct theory would look like? No, no, no, no. We don't have a correct. We don't have any idea of what the output of a correct theory would look like. What would it give you? Right. So for everything else, the cor. A good theory gives you numbers, predictions about specific things that are going to happen. What does a good theory of consciousness give you? So what we would like is something that we say, okay, here's a cat or here's a cat with three extra brain hemispheres grafted on that also has wings. What is it like to be these creatures? Right. What is the output of a correct theory of consciousness? Because if it outputs puts patterns of behavior or physiological states, then what you've explained is physiology and behavior. There are going to be people that say, well, you haven't explained the consciousness at all. In fact, almost all theories of consciousness look kind of eliminativist. Even the ones that aren't trying to be. Even the ones that say, no, no, we're not trying to explain away consciousness. It's real and I'm going to explain it. Then you look at the explanation and you always feel like, yeah, but, but, but you haven't explained the actual, you know, the, the actual consciousness. You've explained some kind of behavioral propensities, physiological states or whatever. So, so that's the problem that we have. Consciousness is the one of those things that cannot exclusively be studied in the third person. Everything else you can study as an external observer. And you don't change much as the observer by, by studying them. Consciousness, you can really only, you know, in a full way. You can only study consciousness by being part of the experiment environment by, by, by seeing, by experiencing it from the, from the first person perspective. So the weak version of this is, you might say, well, a good theory of consciousness is, is a kind. Is Art, what it outputs is art, poetry, whatever. That when we experience it, it makes us experience that conscious state. And we say, oh, so that's what it's like. I see, right. So, so that's, that's one that. But that's kind of a weak form. You can do a stronger form. And you say, well, the real way to do it is to have a rich brain interface. So if I want to know what some other system is, is what its consciousness is like, we need to fuse together. Now caveat to that is you don't find out what it's. If you do that, you know, so, so let's say a rich kind of brain interface, you know, we, we really connect our brains together or something. You don't get to find out what it's like to be that system. You find, both of you find out what it's like to be a new system composed of the two of you. So it's still not. So from that perspective, it's really hard. I mean, you know, people, I suppose people who do meditation or take psychedelics, I suppose they're doing experiments in actual consciousness. But, but third person experiments in consciousness are really hard. You can do things like turn it off, you know, so there's general anesthesia and you can say, oh look, you know, the consciousness is gone. And, and even, and even then some people will say, yeah, but I experienced, you know, floating above my body while you did the surgery. And I, you know, and I saw you drop the scalpel and do this or that. So, so it's still, you know, even, even with that amazing reagent of being able to supposedly shut consciousness, you still get some issues. So the study of consciousness is hard for those kinds of reasons. And I think that about the only useful thing I could say here is that for the same reasons that we associate consciousness with brains, for exactly those same reasons, we should take very seriously the possibility of other forms of consciousness in the rest of our body studies. And, and also lots of other things. But you know, we, and so, so I'm working. So Nick Rouleau and I are working on, on a paper on this where you can sort of look at all the different popular theories of consciousness on the table and you can just ask which of them are specific for brains and why? Like what, what, what aspects of each of those theories really tells you that it's got to be brains. My guess is we haven't finished the paper yet, but my guess right now is that there's not a single one that can distinguish, distinguish brains from other, other other types of structures in your body. And so I think we should take very seriously the possibility that other subsystems of the body have some sort of consciousness. It's not verbal consciousness.",

Are you saying. What if we list all the theories of consciousness and then we place. Does it distinguish the brain as being responsible for consciousness? Yeah, we ask, what is it about that theory that says it's in the brain rather than somewhere else? Let's say you're, let's say your liver. So IIT would say no, because IIT is a panpsychist theory that would say, look, if your liver is doing some processing, then it has some non zero amount of consciousness. Right, right. And I, and I agree with that. Now, now, now, now, as far as I under. As far as I understand, IIT also has an exclusion postulate that says there should only be one central consciousness in the, in the system. I, I think that's true. At least it used to be true. I don't know. Julio may disagree with that, but, but, but, but I think we are actually a, a collection of interacting perspectives and interacting consciousnesses for that reason. And then sometimes people say, well, I don't feel my liver being conscious. Right, you don't, but you don't feel me being conscious either. Of course you don't. And the fact that your left hemisphere has the language ability for us to sit here and talk about it and the liver doesn't, doesn't actually mean that it's not conscious. It just means that we don't have direct access to it and we don't have direct access to each other. So that doesn't, that doesn't bother me. So that's my suspicion about consciousness is that for the same reason that people think it's in the brain, we should take very seriously that it's in other places in the body and then more generally, other types of constructs that are not human bodies at all, or not even animal bodies.",

      "transcript_text": "No, no, no, no. We don't have a correct. We don't have any idea of what the output of a correct theory would look like. What would it give you? Right. So for everything else, the cor. A good theory gives you numbers, predictions about specific things that are going to happen. What does a good theory of consciousness give you? So what we would like is something that we say, okay, here's a cat or here's a cat with three extra brain hemispheres grafted on that also has wings. What is it like to be these creatures? Right. What is the output of a correct theory of consciousness? Because if it outputs puts patterns of behavior or physiological states, then what you've explained is physiology and behavior. There are going to be people that say, well, you haven't explained the consciousness at all. In fact, almost all theories of consciousness look kind of eliminativist. Even the ones that aren't trying to be. Even the ones that say, no, no, we're not trying to explain away consciousness. It's real and I'm going to explain it. Then you look at the explanation and you always feel like, yeah, but, but, but you haven't explained the actual, you know, the, the actual consciousness. You've explained some kind of behavioral propensities, physiological states or whatever. So, so that's the problem that we have. Consciousness is the one of those things that cannot exclusively be studied in the third person. Everything else you can study as an external observer. And you don't change much as the observer by, by studying them. Consciousness, you can really only, you know, in a full way. You can only study consciousness by being part of the experiment environment by, by, by seeing, by experiencing it from the, from the first person perspective. So the weak version of this is, you might say, well, a good theory of consciousness is, is a kind. Is Art, what it outputs is art, poetry, whatever. That when we experience it, it makes us experience that conscious state. And we say, oh, so that's what it's like. I see, right. So, so that's, that's one that. But that's kind of a weak form. You can do a stronger form. And you say, well, the real way to do it is to have a rich brain interface. So if I want to know what some other system is, is what its consciousness is like, we need to fuse together. Now caveat to that is you don't find out what it's. If you do that, you know, so, so let's say a rich kind of brain interface, you know, we, we really connect our brains together or something. You don't get to find out what it's like to be that system. You find, both of you find out what it's like to be a new system composed of the two of you. So it's still not. So from that perspective, it's really hard. I mean, you know, people, I suppose people who do meditation or take psychedelics, I suppose they're doing experiments in actual consciousness. But, but third person experiments in consciousness are really hard. You can do things like turn it off, you know, so there's general anesthesia and you can say, oh look, you know, the consciousness is gone. And, and even, and even then some people will say, yeah, but I experienced, you know, floating above my body while you did the surgery. And I, you know, and I saw you drop the scalpel and do this or that. So, so it's still, you know, even, even with that amazing reagent of being able to supposedly shut consciousness, you still get some issues. So the study of consciousness is hard for those kinds of reasons. And I think that about the only useful thing I could say here is that for the same reasons that we associate consciousness with brains, for exactly those same reasons, we should take very seriously the possibility of other forms of consciousness in the rest of our body studies. And, and also lots of other things. But you know, we, and so, so I'm working. So Nick Rouleau and I are working on, on a paper on this where you can sort of look at all the different popular theories of consciousness on the table and you can just ask which of them are specific for brains and why? Like what, what, what aspects of each of those theories really tells you that it's got to be brains. My guess is we haven't finished the paper yet, but my guess right now is that there's not a single one that can distinguish, distinguish brains from other, other other types of structures in your body. And so I think we should take very seriously the possibility that other subsystems of the body have some sort of consciousness. It's not verbal consciousness. Sorry, I'm not understanding. Are you saying. What if we list all the theories of consciousness and then we place. Does it distinguish the brain as being responsible for consciousness? Yeah, we ask, what is it about that theory that says it's in the brain rather than somewhere else? Let's say you're, let's say your liver. So IIT would say no, because IIT is a panpsychist theory that would say, look, if your liver is doing some processing, then it has some non zero amount of consciousness. Right, right. And I, and I agree with that. Now, now, now, now, as far as I under. As far as I understand, IIT also has an exclusion postulate that says there should only be one central consciousness in the, in the system. I, I think that's true. At least it used to be true. I don't know. Julio may disagree with that, but, but, but, but I think we are actually a, a collection of interacting perspectives and interacting consciousnesses for that reason. And then sometimes people say, well, I don't feel my liver being conscious. Right, you don't, but you don't feel me being conscious either. Of course you don't. And the fact that your left hemisphere has the language ability for us to sit here and talk about it and the liver doesn't, doesn't actually mean that it's not conscious. It just means that we don't have direct access to it and we don't have direct access to each other. So that doesn't, that doesn't bother me. So that's my suspicion about consciousness is that for the same reason that people think it's in the brain, we should take very seriously that it's in other places in the body and then more generally, other types of constructs that are not human bodies at all, or not even animal bodies. You've spoken to Bernardo Kastrup several times now. What is it you agree with him the most that you think most people would disagree about? Because you agree with him that it's nice to go for a walk. Okay, sure. But most people agree it's nice to go for a walk. So what is it that you agree with him about that you think is a contentious issue to most people? So this isn't, this is a controversial statement. And then what is it you disagree with him about regarding consciousness? Yeah, boy, I don't, you know, it's hard for me to know what most people agree or disagree with him about. I really don't know. We agree on a lot of things. We agree on, I think the primacy of consciousness. I think that his idealist position has a lot to recommend it. One thing I think we disagree on is the issue of compositionality. So if I recall correctly from a talk that we had together a little while ago, he felt that it is important in order to be a true self, to have conscious experience and an inner perspective. Perspective you have to be, you know. He focuses on the view of embryonic development as a single system that, you know, whatever subdivides and develops. But it starts out as a single system. And I was arguing that that really is just a contingent feature of biology. I mean, we certainly can take two early embryos and mush them together. You get a perfectly normal embryo out of it. And in general, there are lots of biological systems, like our xenobots, like anthropological robots, that you can create by composition, by pulling other things together. So I don't give as much, I don't put as much emphasis on a system being demarcated from the outside world because it was somehow. Because it started out that way and it sort of remained, you know, disconnected. I think those are, I think that's kind of a superficial aspect of the biology and you can do things a different way. I don't think that's what, what's responsible for. But, but he, he, you know, I, yeah, I think, I think he thinks it's important that, that individual selves are not compositions. They're not made as compositions. They're, they're somehow, you know, individualized from the word go, which again, even the egg. Right. So, so we, I mean, we, we humans like eggs because we can see it as a distinct little thing with a membrane. You say, ah, there's an individual. But, but, but even an egg is composed by the maternal organism from molecular components. Like. I see, I see no, no point at which any of this is truly distinct from anything else. So I put less emphasis on it, but I think he thinks it's important.",

      "transcript_text": "Right, right. And I, and I agree with that. Now, now, now, now, as far as I under. As far as I understand, IIT also has an exclusion postulate that says there should only be one central consciousness in the, in the system. I, I think that's true. At least it used to be true. I don't know. Julio may disagree with that, but, but, but, but I think we are actually a, a collection of interacting perspectives and interacting consciousnesses for that reason. And then sometimes people say, well, I don't feel my liver being conscious. Right, you don't, but you don't feel me being conscious either. Of course you don't. And the fact that your left hemisphere has the language ability for us to sit here and talk about it and the liver doesn't, doesn't actually mean that it's not conscious. It just means that we don't have direct access to it and we don't have direct access to each other. So that doesn't, that doesn't bother me. So that's my suspicion about consciousness is that for the same reason that people think it's in the brain, we should take very seriously that it's in other places in the body and then more generally, other types of constructs that are not human bodies at all, or not even animal bodies. You've spoken to Bernardo Kastrup several times now. What is it you agree with him the most that you think most people would disagree about? Because you agree with him that it's nice to go for a walk. Okay, sure. But most people agree it's nice to go for a walk. So what is it that you agree with him about that you think is a contentious issue to most people? So this isn't, this is a controversial statement. And then what is it you disagree with him about regarding consciousness? Yeah, boy, I don't, you know, it's hard for me to know what most people agree or disagree with him about. I really don't know. We agree on a lot of things. We agree on, I think the primacy of consciousness. I think that his idealist position has a lot to recommend it. One thing I think we disagree on is the issue of compositionality. So if I recall correctly from a talk that we had together a little while ago, he felt that it is important in order to be a true self, to have conscious experience and an inner perspective. Perspective you have to be, you know. He focuses on the view of embryonic development as a single system that, you know, whatever subdivides and develops. But it starts out as a single system. And I was arguing that that really is just a contingent feature of biology. I mean, we certainly can take two early embryos and mush them together. You get a perfectly normal embryo out of it. And in general, there are lots of biological systems, like our xenobots, like anthropological robots, that you can create by composition, by pulling other things together. So I don't give as much, I don't put as much emphasis on a system being demarcated from the outside world because it was somehow. Because it started out that way and it sort of remained, you know, disconnected. I think those are, I think that's kind of a superficial aspect of the biology and you can do things a different way. I don't think that's what, what's responsible for. But, but he, he, you know, I, yeah, I think, I think he thinks it's important that, that individual selves are not compositions. They're not made as compositions. They're, they're somehow, you know, individualized from the word go, which again, even the egg. Right. So, so we, I mean, we, we humans like eggs because we can see it as a distinct little thing with a membrane. You say, ah, there's an individual. But, but, but even an egg is composed by the maternal organism from molecular components. Like. I see, I see no, no point at which any of this is truly distinct from anything else. So I put less emphasis on it, but I think he thinks it's important. It seems like the point that you're saying is, look, we can think about this as several rooms. This building comprises several rooms. But even, and Bernardo may say that's what makes a person is the distinct rooms. But you're saying, yeah, but even in a room there are different people, there are different chairs, there are different tables. Is that what you're saying? What I'm saying is, and I may not be doing justice to his view, and I think you should ask him more about this. This. But I think he thinks that it's important in order to be a unified. So I think we were discussing what makes for a unified inner perspective, right? So we don't feel like billions of individual brain cells. I mean, I have no idea. Well, we kind of do because that's what it feels like to be billions of individuals of neurons. That's really what it feels like. But we do feel, at least most of us, most of the time feel like some kind of unified, centralized inner perspective. And so we were talking about how that comes about. And I think he felt that having that in the physical universe is importantly related to arising from a single origin. So he sees the egg as a single point of origin and arising from that. That's how you are a separate individual from others. And I see it as much more fluid. And I see the boundary between self and world as something I can change all the time. I think it changes in embryogenesis. And that's the scale of. That's the story of the scaling of the cognitive light cone that we about talk talked about. I think it can shrink during cancer. I think it can change during metamorphosis, during maturation. I think it's much more fluid than that.",

I think it can change during metamorphosis, during maturation. I think it's much more fluid than that. Now, as we're on speculative ground, if what makes an agent is the distinction between the self and the world, and some people think of God as the entirety of everything, thus the entire world, and there's no distinction, then can one say that God is an agent? I don't know. I mean, certainly, I think most, well, religions that have a God anyway, as far as my understanding is, they would think that yes, the God has extreme agency, in fact higher than ours. I don't know what that really buys us in any helpful way. Remove the word God. Does the world have agency? Okay, so that's an interesting question. So let's start with first of all, how do we know when anything has agency? Agency. And that's an experimental research program. So you basically you hypothesize what problem space it's working in, what you think its goals are. And then you do experiments to figure out what competency it has. And then you find out, did I guess, well, poorly, do I need to make a better guess? And so on. So for example, people have said to me, well, you know, your kind of panpsychist almost view says that the weather should be, you know, cause cognitive. And I say, I don't say that it is or isn't because we haven't done the experiments? Do I know that? Weather systems, let's say hurricanes or so on. Do I know that they don't show habituation, sensitization, that they couldn't be trained if you had the right scale of machinery? I have no idea. But what I do know is that this is not a philosophical thing that we can decide arguing in an armchair. Yes it is. No it isn't. No, you have to do experiments and then you find out. So now the question is, okay, so what about the galaxy? What about the universe? Are these, the Gaia ecosystems? Again, I think these are all empirical questions. Now some of them are intractable. You know, we don't have the capability to do experiments on a, on a, on a planetary scale. But for example, one thing that I did try to do once was design a gravitational synapse. So design a solar system sized arrangement where masses would fly in and based on the history of masses flying in, it would respond to new masses in a different way. So you can do, you know, historicity and you can have habituation and sensitization and things like that. So could you have something like that that would be very sort of ponderously, slowly on an enormous scale computing something and having sort of simple thoughts? I bet you could, you know. I bet you could. Is the real universe doing that? I have no idea. We have to do experiments. So, you know, here, here you bump up against another question which is how do you know if, if and when you are part of a larger cognitive system. Right? So, so I don't, you know, how do we know if we are in fact part of a bigger, a bigger mind? So I don't know. My suspicion is that there are some sort of girdle like theorem that will tell you that you can never know for sure. And you, you could, you know, you can never be certain, but I bet that you could gather evidence for it. Well, for or against. And I often think about a kind of a, you know, kind of a mental image. Just imagine two neurons in the brain and one is a, is a, you know, kind of a, kind of a strict materialist and one's a little more mystical. And the one neuron says, look, you know, we're just, we run on chemistry and the outside world is a cold mechanical universe and it doesn't care what we do, there's no mind outside of us. And the other one says, can't prove it. But I kind of feel like there's an order to things and I kind of feel like our environment is not stupid. I kind of Feel like our environment wants things from us. And I kind of feel these waves of these waves back propagating through us that are like almost rewards and punishments. I feel like the universe is trying to tell us something. And the first one says, you're just seeing faces and clouds. It doesn't exist. And of course. Course, in my example, the second one is correct because they are, in fact, part of a larger system. They're part of a brain that is learning things. And it's very hard for any one node in that system to recognize that or even a sub network. But I wonder if we could, having a degree of intelligence ourselves, if we could gain evidence that we were part of a larger system that was actually processing information. And I don't know exactly what that would look like, but my hunch is, is that it would look like what we call synchronicity. I think that what it would look like are coincidence, are events that don't have a causal connection. At our lower level, like, mechanistically, by physics, there's no reason why that should be. But at a larger scale in terms of meaning and the greater meanings of things that they do have some kind of interpretation. And I think that's what it would look like to be part of a larger system. I think it would look. It would look and feel like synchronicity. So does it exist? You know, I don't know, but that's what I think it would feel like.",

      "transcript_text": "What I'm saying is, and I may not be doing justice to his view, and I think you should ask him more about this. This. But I think he thinks that it's important in order to be a unified. So I think we were discussing what makes for a unified inner perspective, right? So we don't feel like billions of individual brain cells. I mean, I have no idea. Well, we kind of do because that's what it feels like to be billions of individuals of neurons. That's really what it feels like. But we do feel, at least most of us, most of the time feel like some kind of unified, centralized inner perspective. And so we were talking about how that comes about. And I think he felt that having that in the physical universe is importantly related to arising from a single origin. So he sees the egg as a single point of origin and arising from that. That's how you are a separate individual from others. And I see it as much more fluid. And I see the boundary between self and world as something I can change all the time. I think it changes in embryogenesis. And that's the scale of. That's the story of the scaling of the cognitive light cone that we about talk talked about. I think it can shrink during cancer. I think it can change during metamorphosis, during maturation. I think it's much more fluid than that. Now, as we're on speculative ground, if what makes an agent is the distinction between the self and the world, and some people think of God as the entirety of everything, thus the entire world, and there's no distinction, then can one say that God is an agent? I don't know. I mean, certainly, I think most, well, religions that have a God anyway, as far as my understanding is, they would think that yes, the God has extreme agency, in fact higher than ours. I don't know what that really buys us in any helpful way. Remove the word God. Does the world have agency? Okay, so that's an interesting question. So let's start with first of all, how do we know when anything has agency? Agency. And that's an experimental research program. So you basically you hypothesize what problem space it's working in, what you think its goals are. And then you do experiments to figure out what competency it has. And then you find out, did I guess, well, poorly, do I need to make a better guess? And so on. So for example, people have said to me, well, you know, your kind of panpsychist almost view says that the weather should be, you know, cause cognitive. And I say, I don't say that it is or isn't because we haven't done the experiments? Do I know that? Weather systems, let's say hurricanes or so on. Do I know that they don't show habituation, sensitization, that they couldn't be trained if you had the right scale of machinery? I have no idea. But what I do know is that this is not a philosophical thing that we can decide arguing in an armchair. Yes it is. No it isn't. No, you have to do experiments and then you find out. So now the question is, okay, so what about the galaxy? What about the universe? Are these, the Gaia ecosystems? Again, I think these are all empirical questions. Now some of them are intractable. You know, we don't have the capability to do experiments on a, on a, on a planetary scale. But for example, one thing that I did try to do once was design a gravitational synapse. So design a solar system sized arrangement where masses would fly in and based on the history of masses flying in, it would respond to new masses in a different way. So you can do, you know, historicity and you can have habituation and sensitization and things like that. So could you have something like that that would be very sort of ponderously, slowly on an enormous scale computing something and having sort of simple thoughts? I bet you could, you know. I bet you could. Is the real universe doing that? I have no idea. We have to do experiments. So, you know, here, here you bump up against another question which is how do you know if, if and when you are part of a larger cognitive system. Right? So, so I don't, you know, how do we know if we are in fact part of a bigger, a bigger mind? So I don't know. My suspicion is that there are some sort of girdle like theorem that will tell you that you can never know for sure. And you, you could, you know, you can never be certain, but I bet that you could gather evidence for it. Well, for or against. And I often think about a kind of a, you know, kind of a mental image. Just imagine two neurons in the brain and one is a, is a, you know, kind of a, kind of a strict materialist and one's a little more mystical. And the one neuron says, look, you know, we're just, we run on chemistry and the outside world is a cold mechanical universe and it doesn't care what we do, there's no mind outside of us. And the other one says, can't prove it. But I kind of feel like there's an order to things and I kind of feel like our environment is not stupid. I kind of Feel like our environment wants things from us. And I kind of feel these waves of these waves back propagating through us that are like almost rewards and punishments. I feel like the universe is trying to tell us something. And the first one says, you're just seeing faces and clouds. It doesn't exist. And of course. Course, in my example, the second one is correct because they are, in fact, part of a larger system. They're part of a brain that is learning things. And it's very hard for any one node in that system to recognize that or even a sub network. But I wonder if we could, having a degree of intelligence ourselves, if we could gain evidence that we were part of a larger system that was actually processing information. And I don't know exactly what that would look like, but my hunch is, is that it would look like what we call synchronicity. I think that what it would look like are coincidence, are events that don't have a causal connection. At our lower level, like, mechanistically, by physics, there's no reason why that should be. But at a larger scale in terms of meaning and the greater meanings of things that they do have some kind of interpretation. And I think that's what it would look like to be part of a larger system. I think it would look. It would look and feel like synchronicity. So does it exist? You know, I don't know, but that's what I think it would feel like.",

      "transcript_text": "Okay, so that's an interesting question. So let's start with first of all, how do we know when anything has agency? Agency. And that's an experimental research program. So you basically you hypothesize what problem space it's working in, what you think its goals are. And then you do experiments to figure out what competency it has. And then you find out, did I guess, well, poorly, do I need to make a better guess? And so on. So for example, people have said to me, well, you know, your kind of panpsychist almost view says that the weather should be, you know, cause cognitive. And I say, I don't say that it is or isn't because we haven't done the experiments? Do I know that? Weather systems, let's say hurricanes or so on. Do I know that they don't show habituation, sensitization, that they couldn't be trained if you had the right scale of machinery? I have no idea. But what I do know is that this is not a philosophical thing that we can decide arguing in an armchair. Yes it is. No it isn't. No, you have to do experiments and then you find out. So now the question is, okay, so what about the galaxy? What about the universe? Are these, the Gaia ecosystems? Again, I think these are all empirical questions. Now some of them are intractable. You know, we don't have the capability to do experiments on a, on a, on a planetary scale. But for example, one thing that I did try to do once was design a gravitational synapse. So design a solar system sized arrangement where masses would fly in and based on the history of masses flying in, it would respond to new masses in a different way. So you can do, you know, historicity and you can have habituation and sensitization and things like that. So could you have something like that that would be very sort of ponderously, slowly on an enormous scale computing something and having sort of simple thoughts? I bet you could, you know. I bet you could. Is the real universe doing that? I have no idea. We have to do experiments. So, you know, here, here you bump up against another question which is how do you know if, if and when you are part of a larger cognitive system. Right? So, so I don't, you know, how do we know if we are in fact part of a bigger, a bigger mind? So I don't know. My suspicion is that there are some sort of girdle like theorem that will tell you that you can never know for sure. And you, you could, you know, you can never be certain, but I bet that you could gather evidence for it. Well, for or against. And I often think about a kind of a, you know, kind of a mental image. Just imagine two neurons in the brain and one is a, is a, you know, kind of a, kind of a strict materialist and one's a little more mystical. And the one neuron says, look, you know, we're just, we run on chemistry and the outside world is a cold mechanical universe and it doesn't care what we do, there's no mind outside of us. And the other one says, can't prove it. But I kind of feel like there's an order to things and I kind of feel like our environment is not stupid. I kind of Feel like our environment wants things from us. And I kind of feel these waves of these waves back propagating through us that are like almost rewards and punishments. I feel like the universe is trying to tell us something. And the first one says, you're just seeing faces and clouds. It doesn't exist. And of course. Course, in my example, the second one is correct because they are, in fact, part of a larger system. They're part of a brain that is learning things. And it's very hard for any one node in that system to recognize that or even a sub network. But I wonder if we could, having a degree of intelligence ourselves, if we could gain evidence that we were part of a larger system that was actually processing information. And I don't know exactly what that would look like, but my hunch is, is that it would look like what we call synchronicity. I think that what it would look like are coincidence, are events that don't have a causal connection. At our lower level, like, mechanistically, by physics, there's no reason why that should be. But at a larger scale in terms of meaning and the greater meanings of things that they do have some kind of interpretation. And I think that's what it would look like to be part of a larger system. I think it would look. It would look and feel like synchronicity. So does it exist? You know, I don't know, but that's what I think it would feel like.",

I think it would look. It would look and feel like synchronicity. So does it exist? You know, I don't know, but that's what I think it would feel like. Take me through the history of the Levin Lab. When did it start? What were your. What were your first breakthroughs? Yeah. Okay, let's see. Well, it started. I mean, it. It started in my head when I was pretty young. Like, I was. It was a dream that I had to. To do this kind of stuff. I consider myself to be the luckiest person in the world. I get to do the funnest stuff with the best people. So, yeah, I think it's super, super fortunate. But I kind of had this idea when I was very young. I had no idea what it was like. I was pretty sure that it was actually impossible. I never really thought it would be practically feasible, but I figured I would push it as far as I could before I would have to go back to coding because. Yeah, for people who are unaware, your background's also in computer science, right? Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We. You know, I learned to program pretty young. And at that time, that was a good way to. That was a pretty good way to. To make money. And I just figured I would do the biology as long as I could. And then eventually I would get kicked out and then, then I would just go, you know, go back to coding. So yeah, my, my lab actually began in September of 2000. That's when I got, I got a facial faculty position at the Foresight Institute at the Harvard Medical School. And, and I, yeah, we opened, we opened our doors in 2000. It was just, it was just me at first and then me and one other technician. There's, there's like 42 of us now, but at the time it was just, it was just me and, and a tech name Adam. And that was the first time, you know, starting then was the first time that I could really start to take practically in, in, you know, to, to be practical about some of the, some of the ideas I had about bioelect and all these things. Prior to that I was building up a tool chest. So I was building up skills, techniques, you know, information and so on. But being a grad student and then a postdoc, I wasn't able to talk about any of these things. But, but then when I was on my own and, and then, then that was the time to get going. So just a couple of, you know, a couple of interesting, interesting milestones already. By the time I got, you know, I, I, we, we opened the lab, I was involved in a collaboration with, with Ken Robinson and his, his postdoc Thorley Thorlen. And together with, and with my postdoc mentor Mark Mercola, we really showed the first molecular tools for bioelectricity. So we had a paper on left, right asymmetry and we showed, we showed the first bioelectric tracking of non neural bioelectric states in the chicken embryo. We showed that it was important for setting up which side is left, which side is right and then manipulating that information using injected ion channel constructs. So that was the first time any of that, you know, reading and writing the mind of the body, which is how I certainly wouldn't have said it back then, but this is how I see it now. That was the first time that was done in a molecular way. So that cell paper came out I think 2002. I think it finally came out. But that was a really early, really early project. The other really early project was as a postdoc I started gathering tools for this whole effort and a lot of those tools were DNA plasmids encoding different ion channels. And so what I would do is I would write, send emails or letters to people working in electrophysiology, gut physiology, inner ear, and they would have some potassium channel that they had cloned. And I would say, could I get one of these plasmids? And I was telling them what I was going to do. I would say, and what I'm going to do is use it to express it in embryos in various locations and use it to, in a very targeted way, change the bioelectrical properties of these things. And most people were very nice, and they sent me these constructs. One person sent a letter to my postdoc mentor to say that I had clearly had a mental breakdown and that he should be careful because this is so insane that I'm. I'm obviously off my rocket, right? And so I remember now.",

And I just figured I would do the biology as long as I could. And then eventually I would get kicked out and then, then I would just go, you know, go back to coding. So yeah, my, my lab actually began in September of 2000. That's when I got, I got a facial faculty position at the Foresight Institute at the Harvard Medical School. And, and I, yeah, we opened, we opened our doors in 2000. It was just, it was just me at first and then me and one other technician. There's, there's like 42 of us now, but at the time it was just, it was just me and, and a tech name Adam. And that was the first time, you know, starting then was the first time that I could really start to take practically in, in, you know, to, to be practical about some of the, some of the ideas I had about bioelect and all these things. Prior to that I was building up a tool chest. So I was building up skills, techniques, you know, information and so on. But being a grad student and then a postdoc, I wasn't able to talk about any of these things. But, but then when I was on my own and, and then, then that was the time to get going. So just a couple of, you know, a couple of interesting, interesting milestones already. By the time I got, you know, I, I, we, we opened the lab, I was involved in a collaboration with, with Ken Robinson and his, his postdoc Thorley Thorlen. And together with, and with my postdoc mentor Mark Mercola, we really showed the first molecular tools for bioelectricity. So we had a paper on left, right asymmetry and we showed, we showed the first bioelectric tracking of non neural bioelectric states in the chicken embryo. We showed that it was important for setting up which side is left, which side is right and then manipulating that information using injected ion channel constructs. So that was the first time any of that, you know, reading and writing the mind of the body, which is how I certainly wouldn't have said it back then, but this is how I see it now. That was the first time that was done in a molecular way. So that cell paper came out I think 2002. I think it finally came out. But that was a really early, really early project. The other really early project was as a postdoc I started gathering tools for this whole effort and a lot of those tools were DNA plasmids encoding different ion channels. And so what I would do is I would write, send emails or letters to people working in electrophysiology, gut physiology, inner ear, and they would have some potassium channel that they had cloned. And I would say, could I get one of these plasmids? And I was telling them what I was going to do. I would say, and what I'm going to do is use it to express it in embryos in various locations and use it to, in a very targeted way, change the bioelectrical properties of these things. And most people were very nice, and they sent me these constructs. One person sent a letter to my postdoc mentor to say that I had clearly had a mental breakdown and that he should be careful because this is so insane that I'm. I'm obviously off my rocket, right?

One person sent a letter to my postdoc mentor to say that I had clearly had a mental breakdown and that he should be careful because this is so insane that I'm. I'm obviously off my rocket, right? And so I remember now. Wait, is this your recapitulation of what they said or they actually said mental breakdown? Well, well, okay, so I, I didn't see the letter, but my boss came to me. So, so my boss came to me and, and he was laughing and he said, and he said, look at this. This guy says you're nuts. You asked him for, for a plasmid? He told me to be, you know, to watch out. He says you're having a psychiatric break. So, so that's what, that's what I'm, I'm relaying is what, what he said to me. Okay, so, but, but nevertheless, most people sent constructs and, and when we got to lab, when my lab opened, I started doing that. I started mis. Expressing these things in embryos just to see the space of possible changes. What does bioelectricity really do? I mean, nobody knew at the time. It was really crazy. It was thought that membrane voltage was a housekeeping parameter. There was an epiphenomenon of other things that cells were doing and that if you mess with it, all you're going to get is uninterpretable death. Everybody thought this was a stupid idea. And so we started doing, Doing this. And I had this. I had this graduate student. She was in the dental program. Her name was Ivy Chen, and she was in the dental program, and she had, she had amazing hands. And so I taught her to micro inject RNA into cells in the, in the embryos because, you know, she had, like, really, really good hands. How do you know she had good hands before she tried that? Well, you look like you have good hands. Well, she was a dental student. And so, so I talked to her. She wanted to do research. And I said, tell me, tell me what you do. And they said, oh, I do these. You know, I sew up people's, you know, gums and whatever. And I said, okay. You, you probably could do this. Okay, so she wasn't playing Call of Duty. No, no, no. She. Well, she may have been also, but I don't know anything. I don't know that. What I know is that she was doing, you know, surgeries in, in people's mouths. And, and I thought that, that she may be able to, you know, in, in tight, confined places, you know, with the glasses and everything. So I thought, I thought she would be able to do this through a microscope. And she, and she was. And so, and so we, we did this, we did this together and we injected these, these constructs. And I still remember to this day, she calls me in one day and she says, so I looked at the embryos and they're, they're covered with some kind of black dots. And I said, black dots. Let me, let me see. Let's go, let's go look. So I, so I come out and we look, we look through the microscope. The black dots were eyes. What she had done was, what she had done was the potassium channel that she injected was the one that we later. It took years to publish the paper. But what she, what she had discovered is that is a particular bioelectrical state that tells cells to build an eye. It's, it's remarkable because right, right there and then you knew that a bioelectricity was instructive. It was not an EPI phenomenon because it controls which organs you get. B. That it's, that the whole system is modular and hierarchical because we did not tell the cells how to build an eye. So we, we didn't say where the stem cells go or what cells go next to what other cells or what genes should be expressed. We did none of that. We triggered a high level subroutine that says build an eye here. So right away that, that one experiment like, told us, told us all these amazing things. Then, then eventually, and this was the work of a grad student, Sherry Au, in my group who took, you know, took on the, the, the project and she did a whole PhD on this, showing that. The other amazing thing about it is that if you only target a few cells, what they do is they get their neighbors to help out because they can tell there's not enough of them to build an eye. You know, kind of like ants, you know, when the ants recruit their, their, their buddies to take on a bigger task. So that tells you that the material you're working with has these amazing properties that you don't have to micromanage. Right? It's a different kind of Engineering. It's engineering, as I put it recently in a recent paper, it's engineering with agential materials because it's a material with competencies with an agenda. You don't have to control it the way you do wood and metal and things like that. So, okay, so anyway, so that kind of thing. Then we had a bunch more work on left, right asymmetry and showing how the cells in the body decide which side they're on based on these electrical cues. Then we discovered that in order for cells to the way they interpret these electrical cues had to do with the movement of serotonin. So long before the nervous system or the brain shows up, the body is using serotonin to interpret electrical signals. So this was really underscoring the idea of that. A lot of the tools, concepts, reagents, pathways, mechanisms from neuroscience really have their origin much earlier. And so this was a completely new role for serotonin. Right. So serotonin is a neurotransmitter, does many interesting things. But long before your brain appears, it also controls which direction of your body, your heart and your various other organs go to. So trying to understand in the short term, how does electrical activity control cell behavior. Behavior. But bigger picture, while these neural like processes are going on in cells that are absolutely not neurons, much more long before that. So that was kind of cool. Then I hired a postdoc named Danny Adams, who later became a faculty member and a colleague. And one of the things that she did was to pioneer the early use of voltage sensitive dyes to read these electrical potentials. And so she discovered, in the work that she did in my group, she discovered this, this thing we call the electric face.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, well, okay, so I, I didn't see the letter, but my boss came to me. So, so my boss came to me and, and he was laughing and he said, and he said, look at this. This guy says you're nuts. You asked him for, for a plasmid? He told me to be, you know, to watch out. He says you're having a psychiatric break. So, so that's what, that's what I'm, I'm relaying is what, what he said to me. Okay, so, but, but nevertheless, most people sent constructs and, and when we got to lab, when my lab opened, I started doing that. I started mis. Expressing these things in embryos just to see the space of possible changes. What does bioelectricity really do? I mean, nobody knew at the time. It was really crazy. It was thought that membrane voltage was a housekeeping parameter. There was an epiphenomenon of other things that cells were doing and that if you mess with it, all you're going to get is uninterpretable death. Everybody thought this was a stupid idea. And so we started doing, Doing this. And I had this. I had this graduate student. She was in the dental program. Her name was Ivy Chen, and she was in the dental program, and she had, she had amazing hands. And so I taught her to micro inject RNA into cells in the, in the embryos because, you know, she had, like, really, really good hands. How do you know she had good hands before she tried that? Well, you look like you have good hands. Well, she was a dental student. And so, so I talked to her. She wanted to do research. And I said, tell me, tell me what you do. And they said, oh, I do these. You know, I sew up people's, you know, gums and whatever. And I said, okay. You, you probably could do this. Okay, so she wasn't playing Call of Duty. No, no, no. She. Well, she may have been also, but I don't know anything. I don't know that. What I know is that she was doing, you know, surgeries in, in people's mouths. And, and I thought that, that she may be able to, you know, in, in tight, confined places, you know, with the glasses and everything. So I thought, I thought she would be able to do this through a microscope. And she, and she was. And so, and so we, we did this, we did this together and we injected these, these constructs. And I still remember to this day, she calls me in one day and she says, so I looked at the embryos and they're, they're covered with some kind of black dots. And I said, black dots. Let me, let me see. Let's go, let's go look. So I, so I come out and we look, we look through the microscope. The black dots were eyes. What she had done was, what she had done was the potassium channel that she injected was the one that we later. It took years to publish the paper. But what she, what she had discovered is that is a particular bioelectrical state that tells cells to build an eye. It's, it's remarkable because right, right there and then you knew that a bioelectricity was instructive. It was not an EPI phenomenon because it controls which organs you get. B. That it's, that the whole system is modular and hierarchical because we did not tell the cells how to build an eye. So we, we didn't say where the stem cells go or what cells go next to what other cells or what genes should be expressed. We did none of that. We triggered a high level subroutine that says build an eye here. So right away that, that one experiment like, told us, told us all these amazing things. Then, then eventually, and this was the work of a grad student, Sherry Au, in my group who took, you know, took on the, the, the project and she did a whole PhD on this, showing that. The other amazing thing about it is that if you only target a few cells, what they do is they get their neighbors to help out because they can tell there's not enough of them to build an eye. You know, kind of like ants, you know, when the ants recruit their, their, their buddies to take on a bigger task. So that tells you that the material you're working with has these amazing properties that you don't have to micromanage. Right? It's a different kind of Engineering. It's engineering, as I put it recently in a recent paper, it's engineering with agential materials because it's a material with competencies with an agenda. You don't have to control it the way you do wood and metal and things like that. So, okay, so anyway, so that kind of thing.

And, and I thought that, that she may be able to, you know, in, in tight, confined places, you know, with the glasses and everything. So I thought, I thought she would be able to do this through a microscope. And she, and she was. And so, and so we, we did this, we did this together and we injected these, these constructs. And I still remember to this day, she calls me in one day and she says, so I looked at the embryos and they're, they're covered with some kind of black dots. And I said, black dots. Let me, let me see. Let's go, let's go look. So I, so I come out and we look, we look through the microscope. The black dots were eyes. What she had done was, what she had done was the potassium channel that she injected was the one that we later. It took years to publish the paper. But what she, what she had discovered is that is a particular bioelectrical state that tells cells to build an eye. It's, it's remarkable because right, right there and then you knew that a bioelectricity was instructive. It was not an EPI phenomenon because it controls which organs you get. B. That it's, that the whole system is modular and hierarchical because we did not tell the cells how to build an eye. So we, we didn't say where the stem cells go or what cells go next to what other cells or what genes should be expressed. We did none of that. We triggered a high level subroutine that says build an eye here. So right away that, that one experiment like, told us, told us all these amazing things. Then, then eventually, and this was the work of a grad student, Sherry Au, in my group who took, you know, took on the, the, the project and she did a whole PhD on this, showing that. The other amazing thing about it is that if you only target a few cells, what they do is they get their neighbors to help out because they can tell there's not enough of them to build an eye. You know, kind of like ants, you know, when the ants recruit their, their, their buddies to take on a bigger task. So that tells you that the material you're working with has these amazing properties that you don't have to micromanage. Right? It's a different kind of Engineering. It's engineering, as I put it recently in a recent paper, it's engineering with agential materials because it's a material with competencies with an agenda. You don't have to control it the way you do wood and metal and things like that. So, okay, so anyway, so that kind of thing. Then we had a bunch more work on left, right asymmetry and showing how the cells in the body decide which side they're on based on these electrical cues. Then we discovered that in order for cells to the way they interpret these electrical cues had to do with the movement of serotonin. So long before the nervous system or the brain shows up, the body is using serotonin to interpret electrical signals. So this was really underscoring the idea of that. A lot of the tools, concepts, reagents, pathways, mechanisms from neuroscience really have their origin much earlier. And so this was a completely new role for serotonin. Right. So serotonin is a neurotransmitter, does many interesting things. But long before your brain appears, it also controls which direction of your body, your heart and your various other organs go to. So trying to understand in the short term, how does electrical activity control cell behavior. Behavior. But bigger picture, while these neural like processes are going on in cells that are absolutely not neurons, much more long before that. So that was kind of cool. Then I hired a postdoc named Danny Adams, who later became a faculty member and a colleague. And one of the things that she did was to pioneer the early use of voltage sensitive dyes to read these electrical potentials. And so she discovered, in the work that she did in my group, she discovered this, this thing we call the electric face. And approximately what year is this now? Oh, this is the electric face. This is probably 2008, something like that. 2007, 2008. And what she had discovered was that if you look at the nascent ectoderm that later will regionalize to become face and mouth, you know, eyes and mouth and all of that, Early, early on, before all the genes turn on that determine where all those things will go, the bioelectric pattern within that ectoderm looks like the face. It, it shows you where all this stuff is going to go. And then, and then we, ultimately we were able to show that. And by the way, there was that eye spot, which, which is, which is why the eye thing worked. And we were able to show that all kinds of birth defects that mess up the formation of face do it by inhibiting the normal bioelectric pattern and that you could fix it, you know, you could, you exert repair effects that way. So that was interesting. Then we started looking at regeneration. And again the early work was done also by Danny and then later on by Kelly Chang, who's now a faculty member at University of Las Vegas, where what we did was we showed that tadpole tail regeneration was also bioelectrically driven. And that was our first gain of function effect in regeneration where we able to show that we could actually induce new regeneration. So the tail is a very complex organ. It has spinal cord, muscle, bone, well, not bone, vasculature, innervation, you know, peripheral innovation, skin. And so we took, we took tadpoles that normally do not regenerate. There's a, there's a stage at which they, they can't regenerate their tails. And we developed a bioelectric cocktail that induces it to, to grow. My, my, my, my postdoc at the time Kelly changing said I soaked them and I said well how long did you soak them for? And she said an hour. And I thought but that's got to be too short. There's no way an hour soak is going to do anything. And sure enough, that hour soak led to eight days of regeneration where we don't touch it at all. And the most recent version of that work is in the frog leg where we show that 24 hour stimulation with our cocktail induces a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. So the amazing thing there is again, this is not micromanagement, this is not 3D printing. This is not us telling every cell where to go during this incredible year and a half long process. This is at the very earliest moment you communicate to the cells go down the leg building path, not the scarring path, and that's it. And then you take your hands off. It's, it's, it's calling a subroutine, it's modularity. It's relying on the competency of the, of the material where you're not going to micromanage it. So that was, so that was the first time that kind of became obvious that that was possible is when she showed that just an hour stimulation of the correct bioelectrical state got the whole tail to commit to regenerate itself. So that was the beginning of our regeneration program after which we went into limbs. And now of course we're trying to push into mammalian limbs. Yeah. Along the way, Celia Herrera, Rincon and Neroshimarugan were other postdocs that showed leg regeneration in frog and so on. Around that time we had another thing. I really wanted to work on cancer and I really wanted to work on this idea that there's a bioelectric component to it. And the way you can think about it is simply that not why is there cancer, but why is there anything but cancer? So why do cells ever cooperate instead of being amoebas, why do they ever cooperate? And so we know that the bioelectric signaling is the kind of cognitive glue that, that binds them together towards these large scale construction projects, maintaining organs and things like that. And so, yeah, so we wanted to study that bielectrically. And so I had, I had two students, Brooke Chernet and Maria Labickin, who undertook that. And we were able to show that using this bioelectrical imaging, you can tell which cells were going to convert ahead of time. You could also convince perfectly normal cells to become metastatic melanoma just by giving them inappropriate bioelectric cues about their environment. So you can, you can, no, no, no genetic damage, no carcinogens, no, you know, oncogenes, but, but just the wrong bioelectric information and they become like metastatic melanoma. And, and best of all, they were able to show that you can actually reverse, not re. Reverse carcinogenic stimuli, for example, human oncogenes, by appropriate bioelectric connections to their neighbors. So we had a whole set of, we had a whole set of papers showing how to, how to control cells bioelectrically. And Juanita Matthews in my lab now is trying to take, take all those strategies into human, into human cancer.",

And the most recent version of that work is in the frog leg where we show that 24 hour stimulation with our cocktail induces a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. So the amazing thing there is again, this is not micromanagement, this is not 3D printing. This is not us telling every cell where to go during this incredible year and a half long process. This is at the very earliest moment you communicate to the cells go down the leg building path, not the scarring path, and that's it. And then you take your hands off. It's, it's, it's calling a subroutine, it's modularity. It's relying on the competency of the, of the material where you're not going to micromanage it. So that was, so that was the first time that kind of became obvious that that was possible is when she showed that just an hour stimulation of the correct bioelectrical state got the whole tail to commit to regenerate itself. So that was the beginning of our regeneration program after which we went into limbs. And now of course we're trying to push into mammalian limbs. Yeah. Along the way, Celia Herrera, Rincon and Neroshimarugan were other postdocs that showed leg regeneration in frog and so on. Around that time we had another thing. I really wanted to work on cancer and I really wanted to work on this idea that there's a bioelectric component to it. And the way you can think about it is simply that not why is there cancer, but why is there anything but cancer? So why do cells ever cooperate instead of being amoebas, why do they ever cooperate? And so we know that the bioelectric signaling is the kind of cognitive glue that, that binds them together towards these large scale construction projects, maintaining organs and things like that. And so, yeah, so we wanted to study that bielectrically. And so I had, I had two students, Brooke Chernet and Maria Labickin, who undertook that. And we were able to show that using this bioelectrical imaging, you can tell which cells were going to convert ahead of time. You could also convince perfectly normal cells to become metastatic melanoma just by giving them inappropriate bioelectric cues about their environment. So you can, you can, no, no, no genetic damage, no carcinogens, no, you know, oncogenes, but, but just the wrong bioelectric information and they become like metastatic melanoma. And, and best of all, they were able to show that you can actually reverse, not re. Reverse carcinogenic stimuli, for example, human oncogenes, by appropriate bioelectric connections to their neighbors. So we had a whole set of, we had a whole set of papers showing how to, how to control cells bioelectrically. And Juanita Matthews in my lab now is trying to take, take all those strategies into human, into human cancer.",

And what she had discovered was that if you look at the nascent ectoderm that later will regionalize to become face and mouth, you know, eyes and mouth and all of that, Early, early on, before all the genes turn on that determine where all those things will go, the bioelectric pattern within that ectoderm looks like the face. It, it shows you where all this stuff is going to go. And then, and then we, ultimately we were able to show that. And by the way, there was that eye spot, which, which is, which is why the eye thing worked. And we were able to show that all kinds of birth defects that mess up the formation of face do it by inhibiting the normal bioelectric pattern and that you could fix it, you know, you could, you exert repair effects that way. So that was interesting. Then we started looking at regeneration. And again the early work was done also by Danny and then later on by Kelly Chang, who's now a faculty member at University of Las Vegas, where what we did was we showed that tadpole tail regeneration was also bioelectrically driven. And that was our first gain of function effect in regeneration where we able to show that we could actually induce new regeneration. So the tail is a very complex organ. It has spinal cord, muscle, bone, well, not bone, vasculature, innervation, you know, peripheral innovation, skin. And so we took, we took tadpoles that normally do not regenerate. There's a, there's a stage at which they, they can't regenerate their tails. And we developed a bioelectric cocktail that induces it to, to grow. My, my, my, my postdoc at the time Kelly changing said I soaked them and I said well how long did you soak them for? And she said an hour. And I thought but that's got to be too short.

      "transcript_text": "Oh, this is the electric face. This is probably 2008, something like that. 2007, 2008. And what she had discovered was that if you look at the nascent ectoderm that later will regionalize to become face and mouth, you know, eyes and mouth and all of that, Early, early on, before all the genes turn on that determine where all those things will go, the bioelectric pattern within that ectoderm looks like the face. It, it shows you where all this stuff is going to go. And then, and then we, ultimately we were able to show that. And by the way, there was that eye spot, which, which is, which is why the eye thing worked. And we were able to show that all kinds of birth defects that mess up the formation of face do it by inhibiting the normal bioelectric pattern and that you could fix it, you know, you could, you exert repair effects that way. So that was interesting. Then we started looking at regeneration. And again the early work was done also by Danny and then later on by Kelly Chang, who's now a faculty member at University of Las Vegas, where what we did was we showed that tadpole tail regeneration was also bioelectrically driven. And that was our first gain of function effect in regeneration where we able to show that we could actually induce new regeneration. So the tail is a very complex organ. It has spinal cord, muscle, bone, well, not bone, vasculature, innervation, you know, peripheral innovation, skin. And so we took, we took tadpoles that normally do not regenerate. There's a, there's a stage at which they, they can't regenerate their tails. And we developed a bioelectric cocktail that induces it to, to grow. My, my, my, my postdoc at the time Kelly changing said I soaked them and I said well how long did you soak them for? And she said an hour. And I thought but that's got to be too short. There's no way an hour soak is going to do anything. And sure enough, that hour soak led to eight days of regeneration where we don't touch it at all. And the most recent version of that work is in the frog leg where we show that 24 hour stimulation with our cocktail induces a year and a half of leg growth during which time we don't touch it at all. So the amazing thing there is again, this is not micromanagement, this is not 3D printing. This is not us telling every cell where to go during this incredible year and a half long process. This is at the very earliest moment you communicate to the cells go down the leg building path, not the scarring path, and that's it. And then you take your hands off. It's, it's, it's calling a subroutine, it's modularity. It's relying on the competency of the, of the material where you're not going to micromanage it. So that was, so that was the first time that kind of became obvious that that was possible is when she showed that just an hour stimulation of the correct bioelectrical state got the whole tail to commit to regenerate itself. So that was the beginning of our regeneration program after which we went into limbs. And now of course we're trying to push into mammalian limbs. Yeah. Along the way, Celia Herrera, Rincon and Neroshimarugan were other postdocs that showed leg regeneration in frog and so on. Around that time we had another thing. I really wanted to work on cancer and I really wanted to work on this idea that there's a bioelectric component to it. And the way you can think about it is simply that not why is there cancer, but why is there anything but cancer? So why do cells ever cooperate instead of being amoebas, why do they ever cooperate? And so we know that the bioelectric signaling is the kind of cognitive glue that, that binds them together towards these large scale construction projects, maintaining organs and things like that. And so, yeah, so we wanted to study that bielectrically. And so I had, I had two students, Brooke Chernet and Maria Labickin, who undertook that. And we were able to show that using this bioelectrical imaging, you can tell which cells were going to convert ahead of time. You could also convince perfectly normal cells to become metastatic melanoma just by giving them inappropriate bioelectric cues about their environment. So you can, you can, no, no, no genetic damage, no carcinogens, no, you know, oncogenes, but, but just the wrong bioelectric information and they become like metastatic melanoma. And, and best of all, they were able to show that you can actually reverse, not re. Reverse carcinogenic stimuli, for example, human oncogenes, by appropriate bioelectric connections to their neighbors. So we had a whole set of, we had a whole set of papers showing how to, how to control cells bioelectrically. And Juanita Matthews in my lab now is trying to take, take all those strategies into human, into human cancer. So this is 2009. This was. Yeah, the first, yeah, the first experiments were done around 2010, 2011, something like that. So when did this conjectural connection between bioelectricity and cancer occur to you? The field was clueless about that. It's not as if they had an opinion and said no. Well, to be clear, the very first person who talked about this was Clarence cone in 1971. So Clarence Cohn in 71 wrote that he had a couple of papers in Science where he showed that resting potential of cells was an important driver of cell proliferation. And he conjectured that it might have something to do with cancer. So this idea floated. Nobody had ever done anything with it. And the tools to study this at a molecular level didn't exist until we made them. So that idea just that bioelectricity is important in cancer had been around before. What I think we brought to it, that was completely new, is the notion that this is also related to cognition. The idea that it's not just that it drives proliferation in cancer, that this is really involved in limiting the size of the cognitive glycone, at which point cells acquire ancient, you know, metastatic like behavior. The way that, you know, amoebas do. That aspect of it, I think is completely new with us. That idea that this really is about the boundaries of the self. You know, I've never seen anybody else talk about that. So around that same time though, something else interesting that happened in 2009, which is that we were studying planaria, we were studying flatworms, and we had shown that when you cut planaria into pieces, the way that these pieces decide how many heads they were going to have is actually related to the ability of cells to communicate with each other using gap junctions, these electrical synapses. And so we had made some two headed worms and so on. And around two 2009, I had this, had this student, this visiting student from BU her name was Larissa. And she, she, we. I asked her to recut the two headed worms. And just in plain water, no more, no more manipulation of any kind. We, we recut them.",

I asked her to recut the two headed worms. And just in plain water, no more, no more manipulation of any kind. We, we recut them. Meaning cut off the heads of them again. Yeah, so. So. So you have a normal one headed worm, you cut off the head and the tail. You have the middle fraction fragment. You soak that middle fragment in a drug that blocks the cells from electrically communicating with each other and they develop heads at both ends. Would that drug that you soak it in be called a biological cocktail? Like, is that what you referred to earlier? It's a different biological cocktail. It wasn't even a cocktail. It was a single. One single chemical. It was really simple. It was just one, one single chemical. And all it does is block cap junctions. And so what that did was change the electric circuit properties that the cells have. And both wounds decided they had to be heads. So now you get these two heads. Worms. So. So yeah, so. So Larissa recuts these two headed worms in plain water. No more manipulation. And she gets more two headed worms. It's permanent. Once, once you've convinced them. Now the genetics are untouched, right? No, no, no. No genomic editing, no trans genes, genetically identical. But the two worms are. The two headed worms are a permanent line now. So, So a couple of interesting things, things there. One is. Well, one is. It shows the interesting memory properties of the medium. Meaning once you've brought it to a new state, it holds, it remembers the two. So it's a kind of memory. It remembers the two headed State. Another interesting thing is that two headed worms were first seen. Well, they were first described in the early 1900s. So people had seen, to be made by other means. People had seen two headed worms, apparently to my knowledge. I don't think anybody's ever written about this. Nobody thought to reconnaissance cut them until we did it in 2009. And I think the reason is because it was considered totally obvious what would happen. I mean their genome is normal. You cut off that second ectopic head and of course it'll just go back to normal. That's what people assume. So this is, this is another, another example of why thinking in these, in these different conceptual ways is it, it matters, it leads to new experiments. Because if you don't think about this as memory, if you're focused on, on the genes as, as driving feedback phenotypes, then you would never, it doesn't make any sense to recut them. But if you start thinking, well, I wonder if there's a physiological memory here, then that leads you to this experiment. So thinking in this way leads to new experiments. And then the other thing it points out is something really interesting. So for pretty much any animal model you can call a stock center. And you can get lines of genetic mutants. So you can get flies with curly wings and mice with crooked tails and weird code patterns and chickens with funky toes. You can get any, you know, any kind of mutant lines. In planaria there are no mutant lines. Nobody's ever succeeded in making anything other than a normal planarian except for our two headed form. And that one's not genetic. And so there's a deep reason which I didn't understand back then. In fact, I think we only, I think I only really figured out what I think it means in the last few months. But, but, but it was, it was striking that, that the only unusual planarian form, permanent planarian form out there was the one that we had made and it was, and that's the one that's not genetic. It's not done by, by the way that you would do this with any other animal. Yeah.",

      "transcript_text": "Would that drug that you soak it in be called a biological cocktail? Like, is that what you referred to earlier? It's a different biological cocktail. It wasn't even a cocktail. It was a single. One single chemical. It was really simple. It was just one, one single chemical. And all it does is block cap junctions. And so what that did was change the electric circuit properties that the cells have. And both wounds decided they had to be heads. So now you get these two heads. Worms. So. So yeah, so. So Larissa recuts these two headed worms in plain water. No more manipulation. And she gets more two headed worms. It's permanent. Once, once you've convinced them. Now the genetics are untouched, right? No, no, no. No genomic editing, no trans genes, genetically identical. But the two worms are. The two headed worms are a permanent line now. So, So a couple of interesting things, things there. One is. Well, one is. It shows the interesting memory properties of the medium. Meaning once you've brought it to a new state, it holds, it remembers the two. So it's a kind of memory. It remembers the two headed State. Another interesting thing is that two headed worms were first seen. Well, they were first described in the early 1900s. So people had seen, to be made by other means. People had seen two headed worms, apparently to my knowledge. I don't think anybody's ever written about this. Nobody thought to reconnaissance cut them until we did it in 2009. And I think the reason is because it was considered totally obvious what would happen. I mean their genome is normal. You cut off that second ectopic head and of course it'll just go back to normal. That's what people assume. So this is, this is another, another example of why thinking in these, in these different conceptual ways is it, it matters, it leads to new experiments. Because if you don't think about this as memory, if you're focused on, on the genes as, as driving feedback phenotypes, then you would never, it doesn't make any sense to recut them. But if you start thinking, well, I wonder if there's a physiological memory here, then that leads you to this experiment. So thinking in this way leads to new experiments. And then the other thing it points out is something really interesting. So for pretty much any animal model you can call a stock center. And you can get lines of genetic mutants. So you can get flies with curly wings and mice with crooked tails and weird code patterns and chickens with funky toes. You can get any, you know, any kind of mutant lines. In planaria there are no mutant lines. Nobody's ever succeeded in making anything other than a normal planarian except for our two headed form. And that one's not genetic. And so there's a deep reason which I didn't understand back then. In fact, I think we only, I think I only really figured out what I think it means in the last few months. But, but, but it was, it was striking that, that the only unusual planarian form, permanent planarian form out there was the one that we had made and it was, and that's the one that's not genetic. It's not done by, by the way that you would do this with any other animal. Yeah. What's your recent discovery been? Well, it's, it's, it's not so much a discovery, it's more of a new way of thinking about it. So, so one of the, one of the weird things about planaria is that because the way, the way they reproduce, at least the ones that we study the way they reproduce is they tear themselves in half and then each half grows the rest of the body. And typically what happens for, for most of Us that reproduce by sexual reproduction is that when you get mutations in your body during your lifetime, those mutations are not passed on to your offspring, right? They, they, they, they disappear with your body and, and then the eggs go on and so on. Well, in planaria, it's not like that. In planaria, any mutation that doesn't kill the cell gets expanded into the next generation because each half grows, you know, grows the, grows the remainder of the body. And so, so their genome is very messy. They have, I mean, in fact, cells can be mixed, they can have different numbers of chromosomes. That's, that's very weird. And I always, I always thought, isn't it strange? And nobody ever talked about this in any biology class that I've ever had. Isn't it strange that the animal that is the most regenerative, apparently immortal, they don't age, cancer resistance resistant, and by the way, resistant to transgenes. So nobody's been able to make transgenic worms is also the one with the most chaotic genome. Now that's bizarre, you would think, but from everything that we are told about genomes and how they determine phenotypes, that the animal with all those amazing properties should have really pristine hardware. You would think that you should have a really clean, really stable genome. If you're going to be regenerative and cancer resistant and not age and whatever. It's the exact opposite. I always thought that was incredibly weird. And so finally, I think, and we've done some computational work now to show why this is. I think we now understand what's happening. And what I think is happening is this. Imagine, let's go back to this issue of developmental problem solving. So if you had a passive material such that you've got some genes, the genes determine what the material does. And so therefore you have an outcome and that outcome gets selected. You know, it either does well or not. And then, and then there's differential reproduction. So the standard story of evolution, then everything works well and everything works like it would in a genetic algorithm. Very, very simple. The problem with it, of course, is that it takes forever. Because let's say that, let's say that you're a tadpole and you have a mutation. Mutations usually do multiple things. Let's say this mutation makes your mouth be off kilter, but it also does something else somewhere else in the tail, something positive, something somewhere in the tail. Under the standard evolutionary paradigm, you would never get to experience the positive effects of that mutation because with a mouth being off, you would die, and that would be that. So selection would weed you out very quickly and you would have to wait for a new mutation that gives you the positive effects without the bad effects on the mouth. Right. So it's very hard to make new changes without ripping up old gains and so on. So that's some of the limitations of that kind of view. But a much more realistic scenario is the fact that you don't go straight from a genotype to the phenotype. You don't go from the genes to the actual body. There's this layer of development in the middle. And the thing about development is not just that it's complex, it's that it's intelligent, meaning it has problem solving competencies. So what actually happens in tadpoles is if I move the mouth off to the side of the head, within a few weeks, it comes back back to normal on its own. Meaning, meaning it can, it can re, you know, re reach again that region of anatomical space where it wants to be. So now imagine what this means. Imagine what this means for evolution when you're evolving a competent substrate, not a passive substrate. By the time a nice tadpole goes up for selection to see whether it gets to reproduce or not, selection can't really see whether it looks good because the genome was great or because the genome was actually so, so, but it fixed whatever, whatever issue it had, right? So, so that competency starts to hide information from selection. So, so selection finds it kind of hard to, to choose the best genome because even the ones with problems look pretty good by the time, you know, it's time to be selected. So what happens, and we did computational simulations of all this. What happens is that when you, when you do this, evolution ends up spending all of its effort of ramping up the competency because it doesn't see the, the structural genes. All it sees is the competency mechanism. And, and, and if you improve the competency, that makes it even harder to see the genome. And so you have this ratchet, you have this positive feedback loop where the more competent the material is, the harder it is to evolve the actual genome. All the pressure is now on the competency. So you end up with kind of like a ladder, really, an intelligence ratchet, because. Right. And people like Steve Frank and others have pointed this out in other aspects of biology and also in technology. Right. Once RAID array technology came up, it became not as important to have really pristine and stable disk media because the RAID takes care of it. So the pressure on having really stable disk is off. So what it means is that in the case of the planaria that positive feedback loop, that ratchet went all the way to the end. That basically what happened here is that what you've got is an organism where it is assumed that your hardware is crap. It's assumed that you're full of mutations. All the cells have different, you know, numbers of chromosomes. We already know the genetics are all over the place. But all of the effort went into developing an algorithm that can do the necessary error correction and do, and take that journey in morphospace no matter what the hardware looks like. That is why they don't age, that is why they're resistant to cancer, and that's why nobody can make a transgender worm, because they really pay less attention to their genome in that sense than many other organisms. So you can imagine a sort of continuum. So you've got something like CL against the nematode where they're pretty cookie cutters. So as far as we know, they don't regenerate much. It's, you know, what you see, what the genome says is pretty much what you get. Then you've got some mammals, right? So mammals, at least in the embryonic stages, they've got some competency. You can chop early mammalian embryos into pieces and you get twins and you know, triplets and so on. Then you get salamanders. Salamanders are really, they're quite good regenerators, they're quite resistant to cancer, they are long lived. And then, you know, when, when you, when you run that, that spiral all the way to the end, you get planaria, which are these amazing things that have committed to the fact that the hardware is going to be noisy and that all the effort is going to go into an amazing algorithm that lets them do their thing. And, and that's why if you're going to make lines of weird poly planaria, targeting the structural genome is not helpful. But if you screw with the actual mechanisms that enable the error correction, AKA the bioelectricity, that's when you can make lines of double headed and so on. Because now you're targeting the actual, the problem solving machinery.",

      "transcript_text": "It wasn't even a cocktail. It was a single. One single chemical. It was really simple. It was just one, one single chemical. And all it does is block cap junctions. And so what that did was change the electric circuit properties that the cells have. And both wounds decided they had to be heads. So now you get these two heads. Worms. So. So yeah, so. So Larissa recuts these two headed worms in plain water. No more manipulation. And she gets more two headed worms. It's permanent. Once, once you've convinced them. Now the genetics are untouched, right? No, no, no. No genomic editing, no trans genes, genetically identical. But the two worms are. The two headed worms are a permanent line now. So, So a couple of interesting things, things there. One is. Well, one is. It shows the interesting memory properties of the medium. Meaning once you've brought it to a new state, it holds, it remembers the two. So it's a kind of memory. It remembers the two headed State. Another interesting thing is that two headed worms were first seen. Well, they were first described in the early 1900s. So people had seen, to be made by other means. People had seen two headed worms, apparently to my knowledge. I don't think anybody's ever written about this. Nobody thought to reconnaissance cut them until we did it in 2009. And I think the reason is because it was considered totally obvious what would happen. I mean their genome is normal. You cut off that second ectopic head and of course it'll just go back to normal. That's what people assume. So this is, this is another, another example of why thinking in these, in these different conceptual ways is it, it matters, it leads to new experiments. Because if you don't think about this as memory, if you're focused on, on the genes as, as driving feedback phenotypes, then you would never, it doesn't make any sense to recut them. But if you start thinking, well, I wonder if there's a physiological memory here, then that leads you to this experiment. So thinking in this way leads to new experiments. And then the other thing it points out is something really interesting. So for pretty much any animal model you can call a stock center. And you can get lines of genetic mutants. So you can get flies with curly wings and mice with crooked tails and weird code patterns and chickens with funky toes. You can get any, you know, any kind of mutant lines. In planaria there are no mutant lines. Nobody's ever succeeded in making anything other than a normal planarian except for our two headed form. And that one's not genetic. And so there's a deep reason which I didn't understand back then. In fact, I think we only, I think I only really figured out what I think it means in the last few months. But, but, but it was, it was striking that, that the only unusual planarian form, permanent planarian form out there was the one that we had made and it was, and that's the one that's not genetic. It's not done by, by the way that you would do this with any other animal. Yeah. What's your recent discovery been? Well, it's, it's, it's not so much a discovery, it's more of a new way of thinking about it. So, so one of the, one of the weird things about planaria is that because the way, the way they reproduce, at least the ones that we study the way they reproduce is they tear themselves in half and then each half grows the rest of the body. And typically what happens for, for most of Us that reproduce by sexual reproduction is that when you get mutations in your body during your lifetime, those mutations are not passed on to your offspring, right? They, they, they, they disappear with your body and, and then the eggs go on and so on. Well, in planaria, it's not like that. In planaria, any mutation that doesn't kill the cell gets expanded into the next generation because each half grows, you know, grows the, grows the remainder of the body. And so, so their genome is very messy. They have, I mean, in fact, cells can be mixed, they can have different numbers of chromosomes. That's, that's very weird. And I always, I always thought, isn't it strange? And nobody ever talked about this in any biology class that I've ever had. Isn't it strange that the animal that is the most regenerative, apparently immortal, they don't age, cancer resistance resistant, and by the way, resistant to transgenes. So nobody's been able to make transgenic worms is also the one with the most chaotic genome. Now that's bizarre, you would think, but from everything that we are told about genomes and how they determine phenotypes, that the animal with all those amazing properties should have really pristine hardware. You would think that you should have a really clean, really stable genome. If you're going to be regenerative and cancer resistant and not age and whatever. It's the exact opposite. I always thought that was incredibly weird. And so finally, I think, and we've done some computational work now to show why this is. I think we now understand what's happening. And what I think is happening is this. Imagine, let's go back to this issue of developmental problem solving. So if you had a passive material such that you've got some genes, the genes determine what the material does. And so therefore you have an outcome and that outcome gets selected. You know, it either does well or not. And then, and then there's differential reproduction. So the standard story of evolution, then everything works well and everything works like it would in a genetic algorithm. Very, very simple. The problem with it, of course, is that it takes forever. Because let's say that, let's say that you're a tadpole and you have a mutation. Mutations usually do multiple things. Let's say this mutation makes your mouth be off kilter, but it also does something else somewhere else in the tail, something positive, something somewhere in the tail. Under the standard evolutionary paradigm, you would never get to experience the positive effects of that mutation because with a mouth being off, you would die, and that would be that. So selection would weed you out very quickly and you would have to wait for a new mutation that gives you the positive effects without the bad effects on the mouth. Right. So it's very hard to make new changes without ripping up old gains and so on. So that's some of the limitations of that kind of view. But a much more realistic scenario is the fact that you don't go straight from a genotype to the phenotype. You don't go from the genes to the actual body. There's this layer of development in the middle. And the thing about development is not just that it's complex, it's that it's intelligent, meaning it has problem solving competencies. So what actually happens in tadpoles is if I move the mouth off to the side of the head, within a few weeks, it comes back back to normal on its own. Meaning, meaning it can, it can re, you know, re reach again that region of anatomical space where it wants to be. So now imagine what this means. Imagine what this means for evolution when you're evolving a competent substrate, not a passive substrate. By the time a nice tadpole goes up for selection to see whether it gets to reproduce or not, selection can't really see whether it looks good because the genome was great or because the genome was actually so, so, but it fixed whatever, whatever issue it had, right? So, so that competency starts to hide information from selection. So, so selection finds it kind of hard to, to choose the best genome because even the ones with problems look pretty good by the time, you know, it's time to be selected. So what happens, and we did computational simulations of all this. What happens is that when you, when you do this, evolution ends up spending all of its effort of ramping up the competency because it doesn't see the, the structural genes. All it sees is the competency mechanism. And, and, and if you improve the competency, that makes it even harder to see the genome. And so you have this ratchet, you have this positive feedback loop where the more competent the material is, the harder it is to evolve the actual genome. All the pressure is now on the competency. So you end up with kind of like a ladder, really, an intelligence ratchet, because. Right. And people like Steve Frank and others have pointed this out in other aspects of biology and also in technology. Right. Once RAID array technology came up, it became not as important to have really pristine and stable disk media because the RAID takes care of it. So the pressure on having really stable disk is off. So what it means is that in the case of the planaria that positive feedback loop, that ratchet went all the way to the end. That basically what happened here is that what you've got is an organism where it is assumed that your hardware is crap. It's assumed that you're full of mutations. All the cells have different, you know, numbers of chromosomes. We already know the genetics are all over the place. But all of the effort went into developing an algorithm that can do the necessary error correction and do, and take that journey in morphospace no matter what the hardware looks like. That is why they don't age, that is why they're resistant to cancer, and that's why nobody can make a transgender worm, because they really pay less attention to their genome in that sense than many other organisms. So you can imagine a sort of continuum. So you've got something like CL against the nematode where they're pretty cookie cutters. So as far as we know, they don't regenerate much. It's, you know, what you see, what the genome says is pretty much what you get. Then you've got some mammals, right? So mammals, at least in the embryonic stages, they've got some competency. You can chop early mammalian embryos into pieces and you get twins and you know, triplets and so on. Then you get salamanders. Salamanders are really, they're quite good regenerators, they're quite resistant to cancer, they are long lived. And then, you know, when, when you, when you run that, that spiral all the way to the end, you get planaria, which are these amazing things that have committed to the fact that the hardware is going to be noisy and that all the effort is going to go into an amazing algorithm that lets them do their thing. And, and that's why if you're going to make lines of weird poly planaria, targeting the structural genome is not helpful. But if you screw with the actual mechanisms that enable the error correction, AKA the bioelectricity, that's when you can make lines of double headed and so on. Because now you're targeting the actual, the problem solving machinery.",

In planaria, any mutation that doesn't kill the cell gets expanded into the next generation because each half grows, you know, grows the, grows the remainder of the body. And so, so their genome is very messy. They have, I mean, in fact, cells can be mixed, they can have different numbers of chromosomes. That's, that's very weird. And I always, I always thought, isn't it strange? And nobody ever talked about this in any biology class that I've ever had. Isn't it strange that the animal that is the most regenerative, apparently immortal, they don't age, cancer resistance resistant, and by the way, resistant to transgenes. So nobody's been able to make transgenic worms is also the one with the most chaotic genome. Now that's bizarre, you would think, but from everything that we are told about genomes and how they determine phenotypes, that the animal with all those amazing properties should have really pristine hardware. You would think that you should have a really clean, really stable genome. If you're going to be regenerative and cancer resistant and not age and whatever. It's the exact opposite. I always thought that was incredibly weird. And so finally, I think, and we've done some computational work now to show why this is. I think we now understand what's happening. And what I think is happening is this. Imagine, let's go back to this issue of developmental problem solving. So if you had a passive material such that you've got some genes, the genes determine what the material does. And so therefore you have an outcome and that outcome gets selected. You know, it either does well or not. And then, and then there's differential reproduction. So the standard story of evolution, then everything works well and everything works like it would in a genetic algorithm. Very, very simple. The problem with it, of course, is that it takes forever. Because let's say that, let's say that you're a tadpole and you have a mutation. Mutations usually do multiple things. Let's say this mutation makes your mouth be off kilter, but it also does something else somewhere else in the tail, something positive, something somewhere in the tail. Under the standard evolutionary paradigm, you would never get to experience the positive effects of that mutation because with a mouth being off, you would die, and that would be that. So selection would weed you out very quickly and you would have to wait for a new mutation that gives you the positive effects without the bad effects on the mouth. Right. So it's very hard to make new changes without ripping up old gains and so on. So that's some of the limitations of that kind of view. But a much more realistic scenario is the fact that you don't go straight from a genotype to the phenotype. You don't go from the genes to the actual body. There's this layer of development in the middle. And the thing about development is not just that it's complex, it's that it's intelligent, meaning it has problem solving competencies. So what actually happens in tadpoles is if I move the mouth off to the side of the head, within a few weeks, it comes back back to normal on its own. Meaning, meaning it can, it can re, you know, re reach again that region of anatomical space where it wants to be. So now imagine what this means. Imagine what this means for evolution when you're evolving a competent substrate, not a passive substrate. By the time a nice tadpole goes up for selection to see whether it gets to reproduce or not, selection can't really see whether it looks good because the genome was great or because the genome was actually so, so, but it fixed whatever, whatever issue it had, right? So, so that competency starts to hide information from selection. So, so selection finds it kind of hard to, to choose the best genome because even the ones with problems look pretty good by the time, you know, it's time to be selected. So what happens, and we did computational simulations of all this. What happens is that when you, when you do this, evolution ends up spending all of its effort of ramping up the competency because it doesn't see the, the structural genes. All it sees is the competency mechanism. And, and, and if you improve the competency, that makes it even harder to see the genome. And so you have this ratchet, you have this positive feedback loop where the more competent the material is, the harder it is to evolve the actual genome. All the pressure is now on the competency. So you end up with kind of like a ladder, really, an intelligence ratchet, because. Right. And people like Steve Frank and others have pointed this out in other aspects of biology and also in technology. Right. Once RAID array technology came up, it became not as important to have really pristine and stable disk media because the RAID takes care of it. So the pressure on having really stable disk is off. So what it means is that in the case of the planaria that positive feedback loop, that ratchet went all the way to the end. That basically what happened here is that what you've got is an organism where it is assumed that your hardware is crap. It's assumed that you're full of mutations. All the cells have different, you know, numbers of chromosomes. We already know the genetics are all over the place. But all of the effort went into developing an algorithm that can do the necessary error correction and do, and take that journey in morphospace no matter what the hardware looks like. That is why they don't age, that is why they're resistant to cancer, and that's why nobody can make a transgender worm, because they really pay less attention to their genome in that sense than many other organisms. So you can imagine a sort of continuum. So you've got something like CL against the nematode where they're pretty cookie cutters. So as far as we know, they don't regenerate much. It's, you know, what you see, what the genome says is pretty much what you get. Then you've got some mammals, right? So mammals, at least in the embryonic stages, they've got some competency. You can chop early mammalian embryos into pieces and you get twins and you know, triplets and so on. Then you get salamanders. Salamanders are really, they're quite good regenerators, they're quite resistant to cancer, they are long lived. And then, you know, when, when you, when you run that, that spiral all the way to the end, you get planaria, which are these amazing things that have committed to the fact that the hardware is going to be noisy and that all the effort is going to go into an amazing algorithm that lets them do their thing. And, and that's why if you're going to make lines of weird poly planaria, targeting the structural genome is not helpful. But if you screw with the actual mechanisms that enable the error correction, AKA the bioelectricity, that's when you can make lines of double headed and so on. Because now you're targeting the actual, the problem solving machinery.",

      "transcript_text": "Well, it's, it's, it's not so much a discovery, it's more of a new way of thinking about it. So, so one of the, one of the weird things about planaria is that because the way, the way they reproduce, at least the ones that we study the way they reproduce is they tear themselves in half and then each half grows the rest of the body. And typically what happens for, for most of Us that reproduce by sexual reproduction is that when you get mutations in your body during your lifetime, those mutations are not passed on to your offspring, right? They, they, they, they disappear with your body and, and then the eggs go on and so on. Well, in planaria, it's not like that. In planaria, any mutation that doesn't kill the cell gets expanded into the next generation because each half grows, you know, grows the, grows the remainder of the body. And so, so their genome is very messy. They have, I mean, in fact, cells can be mixed, they can have different numbers of chromosomes. That's, that's very weird. And I always, I always thought, isn't it strange? And nobody ever talked about this in any biology class that I've ever had. Isn't it strange that the animal that is the most regenerative, apparently immortal, they don't age, cancer resistance resistant, and by the way, resistant to transgenes. So nobody's been able to make transgenic worms is also the one with the most chaotic genome. Now that's bizarre, you would think, but from everything that we are told about genomes and how they determine phenotypes, that the animal with all those amazing properties should have really pristine hardware. You would think that you should have a really clean, really stable genome. If you're going to be regenerative and cancer resistant and not age and whatever. It's the exact opposite. I always thought that was incredibly weird. And so finally, I think, and we've done some computational work now to show why this is. I think we now understand what's happening. And what I think is happening is this. Imagine, let's go back to this issue of developmental problem solving. So if you had a passive material such that you've got some genes, the genes determine what the material does. And so therefore you have an outcome and that outcome gets selected. You know, it either does well or not. And then, and then there's differential reproduction. So the standard story of evolution, then everything works well and everything works like it would in a genetic algorithm. Very, very simple. The problem with it, of course, is that it takes forever. Because let's say that, let's say that you're a tadpole and you have a mutation. Mutations usually do multiple things. Let's say this mutation makes your mouth be off kilter, but it also does something else somewhere else in the tail, something positive, something somewhere in the tail. Under the standard evolutionary paradigm, you would never get to experience the positive effects of that mutation because with a mouth being off, you would die, and that would be that. So selection would weed you out very quickly and you would have to wait for a new mutation that gives you the positive effects without the bad effects on the mouth. Right. So it's very hard to make new changes without ripping up old gains and so on. So that's some of the limitations of that kind of view. But a much more realistic scenario is the fact that you don't go straight from a genotype to the phenotype. You don't go from the genes to the actual body. There's this layer of development in the middle. And the thing about development is not just that it's complex, it's that it's intelligent, meaning it has problem solving competencies. So what actually happens in tadpoles is if I move the mouth off to the side of the head, within a few weeks, it comes back back to normal on its own. Meaning, meaning it can, it can re, you know, re reach again that region of anatomical space where it wants to be. So now imagine what this means. Imagine what this means for evolution when you're evolving a competent substrate, not a passive substrate. By the time a nice tadpole goes up for selection to see whether it gets to reproduce or not, selection can't really see whether it looks good because the genome was great or because the genome was actually so, so, but it fixed whatever, whatever issue it had, right? So, so that competency starts to hide information from selection. So, so selection finds it kind of hard to, to choose the best genome because even the ones with problems look pretty good by the time, you know, it's time to be selected. So what happens, and we did computational simulations of all this. What happens is that when you, when you do this, evolution ends up spending all of its effort of ramping up the competency because it doesn't see the, the structural genes. All it sees is the competency mechanism. And, and, and if you improve the competency, that makes it even harder to see the genome. And so you have this ratchet, you have this positive feedback loop where the more competent the material is, the harder it is to evolve the actual genome. All the pressure is now on the competency. So you end up with kind of like a ladder, really, an intelligence ratchet, because. Right. And people like Steve Frank and others have pointed this out in other aspects of biology and also in technology. Right. Once RAID array technology came up, it became not as important to have really pristine and stable disk media because the RAID takes care of it. So the pressure on having really stable disk is off. So what it means is that in the case of the planaria that positive feedback loop, that ratchet went all the way to the end. That basically what happened here is that what you've got is an organism where it is assumed that your hardware is crap. It's assumed that you're full of mutations. All the cells have different, you know, numbers of chromosomes. We already know the genetics are all over the place. But all of the effort went into developing an algorithm that can do the necessary error correction and do, and take that journey in morphospace no matter what the hardware looks like. That is why they don't age, that is why they're resistant to cancer, and that's why nobody can make a transgender worm, because they really pay less attention to their genome in that sense than many other organisms. So you can imagine a sort of continuum. So you've got something like CL against the nematode where they're pretty cookie cutters. So as far as we know, they don't regenerate much. It's, you know, what you see, what the genome says is pretty much what you get. Then you've got some mammals, right? So mammals, at least in the embryonic stages, they've got some competency. You can chop early mammalian embryos into pieces and you get twins and you know, triplets and so on. Then you get salamanders. Salamanders are really, they're quite good regenerators, they're quite resistant to cancer, they are long lived. And then, you know, when, when you, when you run that, that spiral all the way to the end, you get planaria, which are these amazing things that have committed to the fact that the hardware is going to be noisy and that all the effort is going to go into an amazing algorithm that lets them do their thing. And, and that's why if you're going to make lines of weird poly planaria, targeting the structural genome is not helpful. But if you screw with the actual mechanisms that enable the error correction, AKA the bioelectricity, that's when you can make lines of double headed and so on. Because now you're targeting the actual, the problem solving machinery. And if you were to look at the genome of the salamander versus the C. Elegans, would the C. Elegans be more chaotic or more orders than the salamander? It's a good question. So nobody's done that specifically? No, as, as far as I know, this is, this is something that we're just ramping up to do now is to start because correct me if I'm. If I'm incorrect, it sounds like the hypothesis Is that if you have a large amount of genetic chaos or what if you can quantify that, then you would have something that would be compensated for in terms of competency or some higher level structure. Yeah, I think that, yes, I think that's a, that's a prediction of, of, of this model that I just laid out. And so, yeah, so we can test that. I mean part of it also is there's an ecological component. I mean you can ask the question, so why doesn't everything end up like planaria? And I think there's an aspect of this that ratchet obviously doesn't run to the end in every scenario because in some species there's a better trade off to be had somewhere else. I wonder if there are three components then. Because then if you don't see a direct correlation that could be hidden by a third factory factor, which I think.",

      "transcript_text": "And if you were to look at the genome of the salamander versus the C. Elegans, would the C. Elegans be more chaotic or more orders than the salamander? It's a good question. So nobody's done that specifically? No, as, as far as I know, this is, this is something that we're just ramping up to do now is to start because correct me if I'm. If I'm incorrect, it sounds like the hypothesis Is that if you have a large amount of genetic chaos or what if you can quantify that, then you would have something that would be compensated for in terms of competency or some higher level structure. Yeah, I think that, yes, I think that's a, that's a prediction of, of, of this model that I just laid out. And so, yeah, so we can test that. I mean part of it also is there's an ecological component. I mean you can ask the question, so why doesn't everything end up like planaria? And I think there's an aspect of this that ratchet obviously doesn't run to the end in every scenario because in some species there's a better trade off to be had somewhere else. I wonder if there are three components then. Because then if you don't see a direct correlation that could be hidden by a third factory factor, which I think. Would probably be environment. It would probably be the ecology of how do you reproduce, how noisy, how dangerous, how unpredictable is your environment. I'm going to guess there's something like that involved here. Yeah, but I think that's starting to kind of explain what's going on with planaria and that. Yeah, so we found the persistence of the two headed phenotype and then Nestor Oviedo and Junji Murakuma and in my group wrote and wrote a nice paper on that and, and so on. And the, the next kind of big advance there by, in, in 2017 was by Fallon Durant, a grad student in my lab who also did something interesting. So, so when you take a bunch of worms and you, you treat them with, let's say this reagent that blocks the gap junctions, typically what you see is okay, you treat a hundred worms, 70% of them go on to make two heads and 30% are unaffected. So we thought they were unaffected because they stay one headed. And we always called them escapees because we thought that they somehow just escaped the action of the octonal. Maybe their skin was a little thicker or something and we never had a good explanation for it. But anyway, there was a 70% penetrance to the phenotype and most things have not 100% phenotype. So it wasn't penetrance. Penetrance just means that when you apply some treatment to a population, not all of them have an effect and not all of them have the same effect. That's true for pretty much every, every drug, every mutation and so on. So, so for years we called them escapees. And then around 2015 when Fallon joined lab, she recut some of those one headed escapees and found that they also do 70 30, that 70% of them became double headed and 30% didn't. And so what we realized was that they're not actually escapees. They're not un affected. They're affected, but the way they're affected is quite different. They are randomized. They can't tell if they should be one headed or two headed and they flip a coin set with a 7030 bias about what they should do in any given generation. In fact, we were able to show that when you cut multiple pieces from the same worm, and we call them cryptic worms. Cryptic because physically they look completely normal. One head, one tail, they look normal, but they're not normal. Because if you recut them, they're not sure what to do. Their memories are bistable. So what happens is that you can cut them into pieces and every piece makes its own decision if it's going to be one headed or two headed, even though they came from the same parent organism with the same roughly 7030 frequency. So that's another kind of permanent line. And the way we studied it more recently was as a kind of perceptual bistability. So like the rabid duck illusion, right? You look at it and it looks like one thing, looks like something else. That's kind of what's happening here. There's a bioelectric vertical pattern that can be interpreted in one of two ways. And that's why they're confused. You know, they're sort of bi stable and they can fall in either direction. So that's another thing we did in Planaria.",

I'm gonna get you to bring us up to 2020 and then to 2024. But first, what is meant, Explain to myself what is meant when you say Levin lab. So there's also Huberman. Lab. Lab. Do biologists, do professors who are in neuroscience or biology get given a lab by the university? Is this standard? Do you share a lab with other people? What's meant by lab? Is it a room? What is it? Yeah, okay, so, so the way, the way this works is basically that when you're finishing up your postdoc, you, you do what people call going out on the market, which means you interview at a bunch of of places and see who will hire you as a brand new junior faculty member. So when you get a job, and so this is considered your first real independent job because you are now in charge of all your successes and failures, it's all up to you. And typically, yes, at that point, you get a lab. So one of the things you do is you negotiate the amount of space you have. Typically, you start off pretty small, and then over time, if you bring in new grants, then you ask for more space, and the lab grows rows. And when they say Levin Lab or Huberman Lab, what they're just referring to is all of the research that is controlled by you, where you make the decisions, where that particular person makes the decisions. So physically. So, for example, I have three different locations on this campus where my research is done. And that's just because there isn't one contiguous space. I mean, I would be happier to have everything under one in one place. But they're large spaces, and so there's a few, few specific locations. All of them are considered part of the Levin Lab because as the principal investigator, I'm the one whose job it is to bring in the external funding to support all the people that work there and to pay for the reagents. And Also, I'm the P.I. of these labs. It's their job to be responsible for the good and the bad of what they do. So that's what it means. It just means you're the principal investigator responsible for determining. Determining what research happens and what happens to that research, who does it. You're hiring, you're, you know, recruiting people. You're writing grants. That's. That's what it means.",

So there's also Huberman. Lab. Lab. Do biologists, do professors who are in neuroscience or biology get given a lab by the university? Is this standard? Do you share a lab with other people? What's meant by lab? Is it a room? What is it? Yeah, okay, so, so the way, the way this works is basically that when you're finishing up your postdoc, you, you do what people call going out on the market, which means you interview at a bunch of of places and see who will hire you as a brand new junior faculty member. So when you get a job, and so this is considered your first real independent job because you are now in charge of all your successes and failures, it's all up to you. And typically, yes, at that point, you get a lab. So one of the things you do is you negotiate the amount of space you have. Typically, you start off pretty small, and then over time, if you bring in new grants, then you ask for more space, and the lab grows rows. And when they say Levin Lab or Huberman Lab, what they're just referring to is all of the research that is controlled by you, where you make the decisions, where that particular person makes the decisions. So physically. So, for example, I have three different locations on this campus where my research is done. And that's just because there isn't one contiguous space. I mean, I would be happier to have everything under one in one place. But they're large spaces, and so there's a few, few specific locations. All of them are considered part of the Levin Lab because as the principal investigator, I'm the one whose job it is to bring in the external funding to support all the people that work there and to pay for the reagents. And Also, I'm the P.I. of these labs. It's their job to be responsible for the good and the bad of what they do. So that's what it means. It just means you're the principal investigator responsible for determining. Determining what research happens and what happens to that research, who does it. You're hiring, you're, you know, recruiting people. You're writing grants. That's. That's what it means. And for the people who are watching. I mean. Sorry, for the people who are listening, there are shots on screen right now of the Levin lab, provided we're able to go later. Okay, so now bring us to 2020 to 2024. Yeah, so. So some of the, some of the latest, most, most exciting things that. Oh, by the way, one thing I didn't mention that happened around between 2015 and 20. I mean, 2020 or so was also Vaibhav Pies. He's also a staff scientist at my lab. We were able to show that you can actually use reinforcement of bioelectric patterns to fix birth defects. So in Frog started. Yeah, so this, all this started in Frog, and we were able to show that there's a range of birth defects induced by other, other means that you can actually repair. So, so complex defects of the brain face hard like these really complicated things. You could actually repair them by very simple changes in the bioelectrical pattern. So I, so I, I, you know, I, I think that's a really important actually story because. Because not only is it a path to birth defects, you know, clinical repair of Birth defects. But it actually shows how again, you can take advantage of this highly modular aspect and you don't have to tattoo instructions onto every cell. For something as complex as a brain or a FA or, or a heart, you can give pretty large scale instructions and then the system does what it does to fix it. Okay, so the next couple of big things after that were first of all, the discovery of xenobots. And this was Doug Blackiston in my group did all the biology for it. And this was in collaboration with Josh Bongard, who's a computer scientist at UVM and his PhD student at the time, Sam Kriegman, who did all the, all the computer simulations for the work. So this was the discovery of the xenobots and the idea of using epithelial cells from an early frog embryo, so prospective skin cells to liberate them from the rest of the embryo where they're basically getting a bunch of signals that force them to be this boring skin layer on the outside of the animal, keeping out the bacteria.",

So they were going to be a skin cell? They were, weren't yet. They were, they were. Well, at the, at the, it's, it's, it's, it's hard because skin isn't, you know, it's not, it's not a real precise term, but it's, it's cells that at the time that we took them off the embryo were already committed to the fate of becoming that kind of outer epithelial covering. They, they hadn't matured yet, but they, they already knew they were going down that, that direction. So, so we were able to show that when you liberate them from those cues, they actually, actually take on a different, a different lifestyle and they become a motile sort of self contained little construct that swims around and does some really interesting things, including making copies of itself from loose skin cells that you provide and so on. Shortly thereafter, a couple of years later, we were able to make anthrobots, which is the same thing but with adult human trachea kill cells and part of that. So there's a couple of reasons why that's important. Very simply, some people saw xenobots and they thought, well, amphibians are plastic, embryos are plastic. Maybe not shocking that cells from a frog embryo can reassemble into something else, but basically this resembles a phenomenon in frog developmental biology known as an, an animal cap. And, and, and you know, one way an animal cap, it's called an animal cap. The animal cap is just basically that top layer of skin cells of Prospective ectodermal cells. It's called an animal cap. So, so some people thought about this as a unique feature of frog developmental biology. And so I wanted to get as far away from Prague and embryo as possible because, because I wanted to show that this was kind of general and a broader phenomena. So what's the furthest you can get from embryonic frog? Adult human. So Gizem Gumushkaya in my group, who just defended her PhD about a month ago, so she developed a protocol to take donated tracheal epithelial cells from human patients, often elderly patients, and let them assemble into a similar kind of thing, a self motile little construct that swims around on its own. And one of the most amazing things that these anthrobots do, and this is just the first thing we tried, so I'm guessing there's a hundred other things in the they can do. But one thing that they can do is if you put them on a neural wound. So in a petri dish, you can grow a bunch of human neurons. You take a scalp and you put a scratch down through that lawn of neurons. So there's neurons here, there's neurons here, and there's a big wound in the middle. When the anthrobots come in, they can settle down into a kind of a, we call it a superbot, which is a collection of anthrobots. And four days later, if you lift them up, what you see is, what they do is they take the two sides, sides of the, of the neural wound and they knit them together so they literally repaired across that gap. So you can sort of start imagining. I mean, there's a couple of things on a practical level you can imagine in the future, personalized interventions where your own cells. No, no, no heterologous, you know, synthetic cells, no gene therapy, but your own cells are behaviorally reprogrammed to go around your body and fix things in the form of these anthropods. You don't need immune suppression because they're your own cells. Right. And so, and so you, so you can imagine those kinds of kind of interventions. It's interesting because a lot of the interventions we use now, we use drugs and we use materials, you know, screws and bolts and things. And then occasionally we use like a pacemaker or something. But generally our interventions are very low agency, you know, and ultimately we'll have like smart implants that make decisions for you and do. But mostly they're very low agency kinds of things. And when you're using low agency tools, tools, the Kinds of things you can do are typically very brittle. In other words, this is why it's hard to discover drugs that work for all patients. You get side effects, you get very differential efficacy in different patients because you're trying to micromanage at the chemical level, a very complex system.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, so. So some of the, some of the latest, most, most exciting things that. Oh, by the way, one thing I didn't mention that happened around between 2015 and 20. I mean, 2020 or so was also Vaibhav Pies. He's also a staff scientist at my lab. We were able to show that you can actually use reinforcement of bioelectric patterns to fix birth defects. So in Frog started. Yeah, so this, all this started in Frog, and we were able to show that there's a range of birth defects induced by other, other means that you can actually repair. So, so complex defects of the brain face hard like these really complicated things. You could actually repair them by very simple changes in the bioelectrical pattern. So I, so I, I, you know, I, I think that's a really important actually story because. Because not only is it a path to birth defects, you know, clinical repair of Birth defects. But it actually shows how again, you can take advantage of this highly modular aspect and you don't have to tattoo instructions onto every cell. For something as complex as a brain or a FA or, or a heart, you can give pretty large scale instructions and then the system does what it does to fix it. Okay, so the next couple of big things after that were first of all, the discovery of xenobots. And this was Doug Blackiston in my group did all the biology for it. And this was in collaboration with Josh Bongard, who's a computer scientist at UVM and his PhD student at the time, Sam Kriegman, who did all the, all the computer simulations for the work. So this was the discovery of the xenobots and the idea of using epithelial cells from an early frog embryo, so prospective skin cells to liberate them from the rest of the embryo where they're basically getting a bunch of signals that force them to be this boring skin layer on the outside of the animal, keeping out the bacteria. So they were going to be a skin cell? They were, weren't yet. They were, they were. Well, at the, at the, it's, it's, it's, it's hard because skin isn't, you know, it's not, it's not a real precise term, but it's, it's cells that at the time that we took them off the embryo were already committed to the fate of becoming that kind of outer epithelial covering. They, they hadn't matured yet, but they, they already knew they were going down that, that direction. So, so we were able to show that when you liberate them from those cues, they actually, actually take on a different, a different lifestyle and they become a motile sort of self contained little construct that swims around and does some really interesting things, including making copies of itself from loose skin cells that you provide and so on. Shortly thereafter, a couple of years later, we were able to make anthrobots, which is the same thing but with adult human trachea kill cells and part of that. So there's a couple of reasons why that's important. Very simply, some people saw xenobots and they thought, well, amphibians are plastic, embryos are plastic. Maybe not shocking that cells from a frog embryo can reassemble into something else, but basically this resembles a phenomenon in frog developmental biology known as an, an animal cap. And, and, and you know, one way an animal cap, it's called an animal cap. The animal cap is just basically that top layer of skin cells of Prospective ectodermal cells. It's called an animal cap. So, so some people thought about this as a unique feature of frog developmental biology. And so I wanted to get as far away from Prague and embryo as possible because, because I wanted to show that this was kind of general and a broader phenomena. So what's the furthest you can get from embryonic frog? Adult human. So Gizem Gumushkaya in my group, who just defended her PhD about a month ago, so she developed a protocol to take donated tracheal epithelial cells from human patients, often elderly patients, and let them assemble into a similar kind of thing, a self motile little construct that swims around on its own. And one of the most amazing things that these anthrobots do, and this is just the first thing we tried, so I'm guessing there's a hundred other things in the they can do. But one thing that they can do is if you put them on a neural wound. So in a petri dish, you can grow a bunch of human neurons. You take a scalp and you put a scratch down through that lawn of neurons. So there's neurons here, there's neurons here, and there's a big wound in the middle. When the anthrobots come in, they can settle down into a kind of a, we call it a superbot, which is a collection of anthrobots. And four days later, if you lift them up, what you see is, what they do is they take the two sides, sides of the, of the neural wound and they knit them together so they literally repaired across that gap. So you can sort of start imagining. I mean, there's a couple of things on a practical level you can imagine in the future, personalized interventions where your own cells. No, no, no heterologous, you know, synthetic cells, no gene therapy, but your own cells are behaviorally reprogrammed to go around your body and fix things in the form of these anthropods. You don't need immune suppression because they're your own cells. Right. And so, and so you, so you can imagine those kinds of kind of interventions. It's interesting because a lot of the interventions we use now, we use drugs and we use materials, you know, screws and bolts and things. And then occasionally we use like a pacemaker or something. But generally our interventions are very low agency, you know, and ultimately we'll have like smart implants that make decisions for you and do. But mostly they're very low agency kinds of things. And when you're using low agency tools, tools, the Kinds of things you can do are typically very brittle. In other words, this is why it's hard to discover drugs that work for all patients. You get side effects, you get very differential efficacy in different patients because you're trying to micromanage at the chemical level, a very complex system.",

      "transcript_text": "They were, they were. Well, at the, at the, it's, it's, it's, it's hard because skin isn't, you know, it's not, it's not a real precise term, but it's, it's cells that at the time that we took them off the embryo were already committed to the fate of becoming that kind of outer epithelial covering. They, they hadn't matured yet, but they, they already knew they were going down that, that direction. So, so we were able to show that when you liberate them from those cues, they actually, actually take on a different, a different lifestyle and they become a motile sort of self contained little construct that swims around and does some really interesting things, including making copies of itself from loose skin cells that you provide and so on. Shortly thereafter, a couple of years later, we were able to make anthrobots, which is the same thing but with adult human trachea kill cells and part of that. So there's a couple of reasons why that's important. Very simply, some people saw xenobots and they thought, well, amphibians are plastic, embryos are plastic. Maybe not shocking that cells from a frog embryo can reassemble into something else, but basically this resembles a phenomenon in frog developmental biology known as an, an animal cap. And, and, and you know, one way an animal cap, it's called an animal cap. The animal cap is just basically that top layer of skin cells of Prospective ectodermal cells. It's called an animal cap. So, so some people thought about this as a unique feature of frog developmental biology. And so I wanted to get as far away from Prague and embryo as possible because, because I wanted to show that this was kind of general and a broader phenomena. So what's the furthest you can get from embryonic frog? Adult human. So Gizem Gumushkaya in my group, who just defended her PhD about a month ago, so she developed a protocol to take donated tracheal epithelial cells from human patients, often elderly patients, and let them assemble into a similar kind of thing, a self motile little construct that swims around on its own. And one of the most amazing things that these anthrobots do, and this is just the first thing we tried, so I'm guessing there's a hundred other things in the they can do. But one thing that they can do is if you put them on a neural wound. So in a petri dish, you can grow a bunch of human neurons. You take a scalp and you put a scratch down through that lawn of neurons. So there's neurons here, there's neurons here, and there's a big wound in the middle. When the anthrobots come in, they can settle down into a kind of a, we call it a superbot, which is a collection of anthrobots. And four days later, if you lift them up, what you see is, what they do is they take the two sides, sides of the, of the neural wound and they knit them together so they literally repaired across that gap. So you can sort of start imagining. I mean, there's a couple of things on a practical level you can imagine in the future, personalized interventions where your own cells. No, no, no heterologous, you know, synthetic cells, no gene therapy, but your own cells are behaviorally reprogrammed to go around your body and fix things in the form of these anthropods. You don't need immune suppression because they're your own cells. Right. And so, and so you, so you can imagine those kinds of kind of interventions. It's interesting because a lot of the interventions we use now, we use drugs and we use materials, you know, screws and bolts and things. And then occasionally we use like a pacemaker or something. But generally our interventions are very low agency, you know, and ultimately we'll have like smart implants that make decisions for you and do. But mostly they're very low agency kinds of things. And when you're using low agency tools, tools, the Kinds of things you can do are typically very brittle. In other words, this is why it's hard to discover drugs that work for all patients. You get side effects, you get very differential efficacy in different patients because you're trying to micromanage at the chemical level, a very complex system. You don't just want agency. You want agency that's attuned to yourself because you get someone else's agency. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not great for you. Exactly. Which is why your own cells, coming from your own own body, they share with you all the priors about health, disease, stress, cancer. You know, they're, they're, they're part of your own body. They already know all of this. And so part of this is, is creating these, understanding how to create these agential interventions that can have these positive effects. I mean, we, we didn't teach the anthrobots to repair neural tissue. We had no idea. This is something they do on their own. Like, who would have ever thought that your tracheal cells, which sit there quietly for, for decades, if you give, if you let them have a little life of their own, they can actually go around and fix neural wounds? Right.",

Which is why your own cells, coming from your own own body, they share with you all the priors about health, disease, stress, cancer. You know, they're, they're, they're part of your own body. They already know all of this. And so part of this is, is creating these, understanding how to create these agential interventions that can have these positive effects. I mean, we, we didn't teach the anthrobots to repair neural tissue. We had no idea. This is something they do on their own. Like, who would have ever thought that your tracheal cells, which sit there quietly for, for decades, if you give, if you let them have a little life of their own, they can actually go around and fix neural wounds? Right. You must have had some idea that this would be possible, otherwise you wouldn't have tested it. No, true, true. Yes. This is true for a lot of stuff in our lab where people say, well, did you know that was going to happen? And so, on the one hand, no, because it's so wild and it wasn't predicted by any existing structures. On the other hand, yes, because we did the experiment. And that's why I did it, because I had an intuition that's how this thing would work. So did I know that it was going to specifically repair peripheral innervation? No, but I did think that it would. That among its behavioral repertoire would be to exert positive influence on human cells around it. And so this was a convenient assay to try. We have a hundred more that we're going to try. There's all kinds of other stuff. Yes, I see, I see. So you're testing out a variety. Correct. You have to start somewhere. Right. And so we said, okay, so Gizem and I said, well, why don't we, why don't we try some, you know, a nice easy neural scar. There's many other things to try. So that's kind of the practical application, but the kind of bigger intellectual issue is much like with the xenobots, what's cool about making these sorts of synthetic constructs is that they don't have a Long evolutionary history in that form factor. There's never been any xenobots, there's never been any anthrobots in the evolutionary history. The anthrobots don't look anything like a human, stages of human, human development. So the question arises, where do their form and behavior come from then? Right, and so this is where you get back to this issue of the Platonic space. Right. If you can't pin it on eons of specific selection for specific functions, where do these novel capabilities come from? And so I really view all of these synthetic constructs as exploration vehicles. There are ways to look around in that Platonic space and see what else is out there. We know normal development takes. It shows us one point in that space that says this is, this is, this is the forum that's, that's there. But once you start making these synthetic things, you, you widen that, that your view of that latent space as to what's actually possible. And I see this research program as really investigating the structure of that platonic space in the way that mathematicians, you know, people make the map of mathematics. Right. And this is the sort of a structure of how the different pieces of math fit together. I think that's, that's actually what's what, what we're doing here when we make these synthetic things is we' vehicles to observe what else is possible in that space that evolution has not shown us yet. Yeah. So. Oh, you know, and then you can do interesting things like, and this is, you know, still unpublished, but you can ask questions like what do their transcriptomes look like? You know, what genes do xenobots and anthrobots express? And, you know, without blowing any of the sort of surprise with the paper, should be out sometime this year. Massively new transcriptional profiles in these things. No, no drugs, no, no synthetic biology circuits, no genomic editing. Just by virtue of having a new lifestyle, they adapt their transcriptional profile. They're the, the genes that they express are quite different. Quite different. So, so that'll be, that'll be an interesting study. And then, you know, for the, for the, for the rest of it, I mean, what we've been doing in the last few years, years is trying to bring a lot of the work that we've done earlier into clinically relevant models. So the cancer stuff has moved from frog into human cells and organoids, spheroids. So human cancer, spheroids and glioblastoma, colon cancer, stuff like that. The regeneration work has moved from frog into mice. So, and this is, it's it's, you know, it's coming along. I'm not, I'm not claiming any particular result yet. This is, I should also say there's an invention, what do you call it? A disclosure here I have to do, because we have a couple of companies now. And so I have to do a disclosure that in the case of regeneration. So Morphaceuticals is a company that Dave Kaplan and I have. So David is a bioengineer here at Tufts and he and I have this company aiming at limb regeneration and more broadly, bioelectrics in regeneration. Regeneration. So yeah, so the cancer of the limb regeneration stuff, you know, more, more, more experiments in trying to understand how to read and interpret the information that flows across levels. So we know cells exchange electrical signals to know how to make an embryo. Turns out embryos actually communicate with each other. So that's been a really exciting finding recently of her, Angela Tung in Migra, which just got her PhD as well, where we studied this embryo to embryo communication, showing that groups of embryos actually are much better at resisting certain defects than individuals. And they have their own transcriptional profile. So I call it a hyper embryo because it's like the next level. They have an expression transcriptome that is different from normal embryos developing alone, let's say. So that's pretty exciting. And yeah, those are the kinds of things we've been focused on.",

      "transcript_text": "Correct. You have to start somewhere. Right. And so we said, okay, so Gizem and I said, well, why don't we, why don't we try some, you know, a nice easy neural scar. There's many other things to try. So that's kind of the practical application, but the kind of bigger intellectual issue is much like with the xenobots, what's cool about making these sorts of synthetic constructs is that they don't have a Long evolutionary history in that form factor. There's never been any xenobots, there's never been any anthrobots in the evolutionary history. The anthrobots don't look anything like a human, stages of human, human development. So the question arises, where do their form and behavior come from then? Right, and so this is where you get back to this issue of the Platonic space. Right. If you can't pin it on eons of specific selection for specific functions, where do these novel capabilities come from? And so I really view all of these synthetic constructs as exploration vehicles. There are ways to look around in that Platonic space and see what else is out there. We know normal development takes. It shows us one point in that space that says this is, this is, this is the forum that's, that's there. But once you start making these synthetic things, you, you widen that, that your view of that latent space as to what's actually possible. And I see this research program as really investigating the structure of that platonic space in the way that mathematicians, you know, people make the map of mathematics. Right. And this is the sort of a structure of how the different pieces of math fit together. I think that's, that's actually what's what, what we're doing here when we make these synthetic things is we' vehicles to observe what else is possible in that space that evolution has not shown us yet. Yeah. So. Oh, you know, and then you can do interesting things like, and this is, you know, still unpublished, but you can ask questions like what do their transcriptomes look like? You know, what genes do xenobots and anthrobots express? And, you know, without blowing any of the sort of surprise with the paper, should be out sometime this year. Massively new transcriptional profiles in these things. No, no drugs, no, no synthetic biology circuits, no genomic editing. Just by virtue of having a new lifestyle, they adapt their transcriptional profile. They're the, the genes that they express are quite different. Quite different. So, so that'll be, that'll be an interesting study. And then, you know, for the, for the, for the rest of it, I mean, what we've been doing in the last few years, years is trying to bring a lot of the work that we've done earlier into clinically relevant models. So the cancer stuff has moved from frog into human cells and organoids, spheroids. So human cancer, spheroids and glioblastoma, colon cancer, stuff like that. The regeneration work has moved from frog into mice. So, and this is, it's it's, you know, it's coming along. I'm not, I'm not claiming any particular result yet. This is, I should also say there's an invention, what do you call it? A disclosure here I have to do, because we have a couple of companies now. And so I have to do a disclosure that in the case of regeneration. So Morphaceuticals is a company that Dave Kaplan and I have. So David is a bioengineer here at Tufts and he and I have this company aiming at limb regeneration and more broadly, bioelectrics in regeneration. Regeneration. So yeah, so the cancer of the limb regeneration stuff, you know, more, more, more experiments in trying to understand how to read and interpret the information that flows across levels. So we know cells exchange electrical signals to know how to make an embryo. Turns out embryos actually communicate with each other. So that's been a really exciting finding recently of her, Angela Tung in Migra, which just got her PhD as well, where we studied this embryo to embryo communication, showing that groups of embryos actually are much better at resisting certain defects than individuals. And they have their own transcriptional profile. So I call it a hyper embryo because it's like the next level. They have an expression transcriptome that is different from normal embryos developing alone, let's say. So that's pretty exciting. And yeah, those are the kinds of things we've been focused on.",

It shows us one point in that space that says this is, this is, this is the forum that's, that's there. But once you start making these synthetic things, you, you widen that, that your view of that latent space as to what's actually possible. And I see this research program as really investigating the structure of that platonic space in the way that mathematicians, you know, people make the map of mathematics. Right. And this is the sort of a structure of how the different pieces of math fit together. I think that's, that's actually what's what, what we're doing here when we make these synthetic things is we' vehicles to observe what else is possible in that space that evolution has not shown us yet. Yeah. So. Oh, you know, and then you can do interesting things like, and this is, you know, still unpublished, but you can ask questions like what do their transcriptomes look like? You know, what genes do xenobots and anthrobots express? And, you know, without blowing any of the sort of surprise with the paper, should be out sometime this year. Massively new transcriptional profiles in these things. No, no drugs, no, no synthetic biology circuits, no genomic editing. Just by virtue of having a new lifestyle, they adapt their transcriptional profile. They're the, the genes that they express are quite different. Quite different. So, so that'll be, that'll be an interesting study. And then, you know, for the, for the, for the rest of it, I mean, what we've been doing in the last few years, years is trying to bring a lot of the work that we've done earlier into clinically relevant models. So the cancer stuff has moved from frog into human cells and organoids, spheroids. So human cancer, spheroids and glioblastoma, colon cancer, stuff like that. The regeneration work has moved from frog into mice. So, and this is, it's it's, you know, it's coming along. I'm not, I'm not claiming any particular result yet. This is, I should also say there's an invention, what do you call it? A disclosure here I have to do, because we have a couple of companies now. And so I have to do a disclosure that in the case of regeneration. So Morphaceuticals is a company that Dave Kaplan and I have. So David is a bioengineer here at Tufts and he and I have this company aiming at limb regeneration and more broadly, bioelectrics in regeneration. Regeneration. So yeah, so the cancer of the limb regeneration stuff, you know, more, more, more experiments in trying to understand how to read and interpret the information that flows across levels. So we know cells exchange electrical signals to know how to make an embryo. Turns out embryos actually communicate with each other. So that's been a really exciting finding recently of her, Angela Tung in Migra, which just got her PhD as well, where we studied this embryo to embryo communication, showing that groups of embryos actually are much better at resisting certain defects than individuals. And they have their own transcriptional profile. So I call it a hyper embryo because it's like the next level. They have an expression transcriptome that is different from normal embryos developing alone, let's say. So that's pretty exciting. And yeah, those are the kinds of things we've been focused on. Okay, now we're going to end on advice for a newcomer to biology. They're entering the field. What do you say? Boy? Well, step one is to ignore most people's advice. So that's. I don't know how helpful that will be, but I actually have, I have a whole thing about. Maybe we can put up a link. I have a whole long description of this on my blog. So on my blog I have a thing that basically talks about what advice. Okay, that's on screen. Also you should know that the previous research by Angela Tong and Gamaskaya. Yeah, we did a podcast together. So that link will be on screen as well. There's also another podcast with Michael Levin which is on screen. And then another one which is on screen with Chris Fields and, and Carl Friston. Another one with Michael Levin and Yosha Bach, that's on screen. So Michael is a legend on, on theories of everything, anything. Okay, so does your advice for the biologist differ from your advice to the general scientist entering the field?",

      "transcript_text": "Correct. You have to start somewhere. Right. And so we said, okay, so Gizem and I said, well, why don't we, why don't we try some, you know, a nice easy neural scar. There's many other things to try. So that's kind of the practical application, but the kind of bigger intellectual issue is much like with the xenobots, what's cool about making these sorts of synthetic constructs is that they don't have a Long evolutionary history in that form factor. There's never been any xenobots, there's never been any anthrobots in the evolutionary history. The anthrobots don't look anything like a human, stages of human, human development. So the question arises, where do their form and behavior come from then? Right, and so this is where you get back to this issue of the Platonic space. Right. If you can't pin it on eons of specific selection for specific functions, where do these novel capabilities come from? And so I really view all of these synthetic constructs as exploration vehicles. There are ways to look around in that Platonic space and see what else is out there. We know normal development takes.

So Michael is a legend on, on theories of everything, anything. Okay, so does your advice for the biologist differ from your advice to the general scientist entering the field? I mean, the most important thing I'll say is I do not in any way feel like I could be giving anybody advice. I think that there are so many individual circumstances that I'm not going to claim I have any, any sort of. How about what you would have wish you had known when you were 20. 20? Yeah, I, I, I, I, So, so, so this is, this is pretty much the only thing I can say about any, any of this. That even, even very smart successful people are only well calibrated on their own field, their own things that they are passionate about. They're not well calibrated on your stuff. So what that means is that if somebody gives you, you, so this is, this is all about, it's kind of meta advice. It's all about advice, advice on advice. And, and, and the idea is that when somebody gives you a critique of a specific product, so let's say you gave a talk or wrote a paper or you did an experiment and somebody's critiquing what you did, right? That, that's gold. So, so squeeze the hell out of that for any way to improve your craft. What could I have done better? What could I have done better to do a better experiment? What could I have done better in my presentation so that they would understand what I want them do to, to understand that that's gold. The part where everybody gives large scale advice, oh, work on this, don't work on that focus, don't think of it this way, think of it that way. All of that stuff is generally speaking better off ignored completely. So people, people are really not calibrated on, on, on you, your, your, your dreams in the field, your idea ideas. You know, you, it, it does not pay to listen to anybody else about what you should be doing and how you really need to be. Everybody needs to be developing their own intuition about, about what that is and testing it out by doing things and seeing how, how they land. And I think that most, most everything that we've done along the way that's interesting and certainly we've had plenty of dead ends and you know, and plenty of, made plenty of mistakes. But most of the interesting things that our lab has done along the way, very, very good, very successful, smart people said don't do this, there's no way this is going to lead to anything. And so the only thing I know is that paths in science are, nobody has a crystal ball. Paths in science are very hard to predict and people should really be very circumspect about taking extremely seriously specific critiques of specific things that will help them improve their process versus these larger scale sort of career level things that yeah, I don't think you should Be taking almost anybody's advice about that.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, I, I, I, I, So, so, so this is, this is pretty much the only thing I can say about any, any of this. That even, even very smart successful people are only well calibrated on their own field, their own things that they are passionate about. They're not well calibrated on your stuff. So what that means is that if somebody gives you, you, so this is, this is all about, it's kind of meta advice. It's all about advice, advice on advice. And, and, and the idea is that when somebody gives you a critique of a specific product, so let's say you gave a talk or wrote a paper or you did an experiment and somebody's critiquing what you did, right? That, that's gold. So, so squeeze the hell out of that for any way to improve your craft. What could I have done better? What could I have done better to do a better experiment? What could I have done better in my presentation so that they would understand what I want them do to, to understand that that's gold. The part where everybody gives large scale advice, oh, work on this, don't work on that focus, don't think of it this way, think of it that way. All of that stuff is generally speaking better off ignored completely. So people, people are really not calibrated on, on, on you, your, your, your dreams in the field, your idea ideas. You know, you, it, it does not pay to listen to anybody else about what you should be doing and how you really need to be. Everybody needs to be developing their own intuition about, about what that is and testing it out by doing things and seeing how, how they land. And I think that most, most everything that we've done along the way that's interesting and certainly we've had plenty of dead ends and you know, and plenty of, made plenty of mistakes. But most of the interesting things that our lab has done along the way, very, very good, very successful, smart people said don't do this, there's no way this is going to lead to anything. And so the only thing I know is that paths in science are, nobody has a crystal ball. Paths in science are very hard to predict and people should really be very circumspect about taking extremely seriously specific critiques of specific things that will help them improve their process versus these larger scale sort of career level things that yeah, I don't think you should Be taking almost anybody's advice about that. Can you be specific and give an example of where you like the minutiae of a critique and then where you disliked the grand scale critique? Yeah, I mean, the minutiae happens every day because every day we get comments on, let's say, a paper submission and we see and somebody says, well, you, you're, you. It would have been better if you, if you included this control or I, I don't get it. Because, you know, you know, it's clear, it's clear that, that the, that the reviewer didn't understand what you were trying to get at. And so that's, that's on us. That's on us to, to, to, to describe it better to do a better experiment that forces them to accept the conclusion whether they like it or not. Right. The best, the best experiment is, is, is one that really it, it forces the reader to a specific experiment conclusion, whether or not they wanted to go there. It's irresistible. It's so compelling, it's clean, it's compelling. So that kind of stuff happens on a daily basis where you see what somebody was and wasn't able to absorb from what you did and you say, okay, how can I do this experiment better? What kind of a result would have gotten us to a better conclusion where everybody would have been able to see. So that stuff happens all the time. The other kind of thing, I mean, I'll give you an example from the tail regeneration kind of era. We showed that normally when tadpoles normally regenerate their tail, there's a particular proton pump that's required for that to happen. You know, a proton pump in the frog embryo. And so what we showed is that you can get rid of that proton pump and then the tail stops regenerating and then you can rescue it by putting in a proton pump from yeast that has no sequence of structural homology to the one you knocked out of the floor frog. But it has the same bioelectric effect. Right. And there, that's how you show that it really is bioelectricity. Right. So, so, so we got two reviews on that paper and the first reviewer said, oh, you found the gene for tail regeneration. That proton pump is the gene for tail regeneration. Get rid of all the electrical stuff, you don't need it. You found a gene for tail regeneration. The second, the second reviewer said, oh, the, the gene obviously doesn't matter because you just replace it by the pro proton pump by the one from yeast. Yeah, get rid of all of that and just do the Bioelectrical stuff, right? So that shows you right away that two different perspectives, each person had a particular way they wanted to look at it. They had exactly opposite suggestions for what to throw out of the paper. And only together do those two perspectives explain that. What's going on here is that, yes, the embryo naturally has a way of producing that bioelectric electrical state. But what actually matters is not the gene, it's not how you got there, it's the state itself. Right? And so that kind of a thing, those kind of perspectives, or the people who are upset at, for example, calling xenobots bots, Right, we call them bots because we think it's a biorobotics platform. So one thing that happens is that you've got the people that, that are sort of from the organicist tradition, and they'll say, it's not a robot, it's a living thing. How dare you call it a robot? And part of the issue is that all of these terms, much like the cognitive terms that we talked about, it's not that the xenobot is or isn't a robot. It's simply the idea that by using these different, using different terms, what you're signaling is what are some of the ways that you could have a relationship with it. So, for example, we think that we might be able to program it, to use it for useful purposes. That's what the bot, that's what the terminology bot emphasizes. Do I think it's only a xenobot? Absolutely not. I also think it's a proto organism with its own, you know, its own limited agency and its own, you know, things that, that we haven't published yet, which we're working on. It's their learning capacity and, and so on. So you often run into that, is that people think any. Everything should only be one thing and that. Right. And that this is all a, a debate about which thing is it. And I, I don't, I don't think that's true at all. Well, there's another. Just, just, you know, kind of one, one last example, again having to do with, with terminology. Somebody said to me once, you know, the people are very resistant to the use of the word memory for some of the things that we study. And she said, why don't you, why don't you just come up with a new term, you know, schmemory or something? And then nobody has to be mad. You know, you can say, okay, like this is, you know, human, human learning is memory. And then this other thing where these other things Learn. Well, that's shmemory. So then. And that, that's the kind of schmintelligence.",

      "transcript_text": "Yeah, I mean, the minutiae happens every day because every day we get comments on, let's say, a paper submission and we see and somebody says, well, you, you're, you. It would have been better if you, if you included this control or I, I don't get it. Because, you know, you know, it's clear, it's clear that, that the, that the reviewer didn't understand what you were trying to get at. And so that's, that's on us. That's on us to, to, to, to describe it better to do a better experiment that forces them to accept the conclusion whether they like it or not. Right. The best, the best experiment is, is, is one that really it, it forces the reader to a specific experiment conclusion, whether or not they wanted to go there. It's irresistible. It's so compelling, it's clean, it's compelling. So that kind of stuff happens on a daily basis where you see what somebody was and wasn't able to absorb from what you did and you say, okay, how can I do this experiment better? What kind of a result would have gotten us to a better conclusion where everybody would have been able to see. So that stuff happens all the time. The other kind of thing, I mean, I'll give you an example from the tail regeneration kind of era. We showed that normally when tadpoles normally regenerate their tail, there's a particular proton pump that's required for that to happen. You know, a proton pump in the frog embryo. And so what we showed is that you can get rid of that proton pump and then the tail stops regenerating and then you can rescue it by putting in a proton pump from yeast that has no sequence of structural homology to the one you knocked out of the floor frog. But it has the same bioelectric effect. Right. And there, that's how you show that it really is bioelectricity. Right. So, so, so we got two reviews on that paper and the first reviewer said, oh, you found the gene for tail regeneration. That proton pump is the gene for tail regeneration. Get rid of all the electrical stuff, you don't need it. You found a gene for tail regeneration. The second, the second reviewer said, oh, the, the gene obviously doesn't matter because you just replace it by the pro proton pump by the one from yeast. Yeah, get rid of all of that and just do the Bioelectrical stuff, right? So that shows you right away that two different perspectives, each person had a particular way they wanted to look at it. They had exactly opposite suggestions for what to throw out of the paper. And only together do those two perspectives explain that. What's going on here is that, yes, the embryo naturally has a way of producing that bioelectric electrical state. But what actually matters is not the gene, it's not how you got there, it's the state itself. Right? And so that kind of a thing, those kind of perspectives, or the people who are upset at, for example, calling xenobots bots, Right, we call them bots because we think it's a biorobotics platform. So one thing that happens is that you've got the people that, that are sort of from the organicist tradition, and they'll say, it's not a robot, it's a living thing. How dare you call it a robot? And part of the issue is that all of these terms, much like the cognitive terms that we talked about, it's not that the xenobot is or isn't a robot. It's simply the idea that by using these different, using different terms, what you're signaling is what are some of the ways that you could have a relationship with it. So, for example, we think that we might be able to program it, to use it for useful purposes. That's what the bot, that's what the terminology bot emphasizes. Do I think it's only a xenobot? Absolutely not. I also think it's a proto organism with its own, you know, its own limited agency and its own, you know, things that, that we haven't published yet, which we're working on. It's their learning capacity and, and so on. So you often run into that, is that people think any. Everything should only be one thing and that. Right. And that this is all a, a debate about which thing is it. And I, I don't, I don't think that's true at all. Well, there's another. Just, just, you know, kind of one, one last example, again having to do with, with terminology. Somebody said to me once, you know, the people are very resistant to the use of the word memory for some of the things that we study. And she said, why don't you, why don't you just come up with a new term, you know, schmemory or something? And then nobody has to be mad. You know, you can say, okay, like this is, you know, human, human learning is memory. And then this other thing where these other things Learn. Well, that's shmemory. So then. And that, that's the kind of schmintelligence. Why are you calling it intelligence? Yeah, yeah, exactly. And, and that's the kind of. Okay, so that, that's just an example of the kind of advice you might get from somebody. And, and in a certain sense, it's true that if you do that, you will have fewer fights with people who are very purist about, you know, they want, they want memory to be in a very particular box. You'll have less fights with those. Those are true. But bigger picture, though. Imagine. So there's, there's Isaac Newton, and then, you know, the apples fall. I mean, I know it didn't really probably happen, but let's, you know, the apples fall in a tree. And he says, okay, so gravity, I'm going to call gravity the thing that keeps the moon, you know, in orbit of the Earth. And then I'm going to call shmavity the thing that makes the apple fall. That way there won't be any arguments. Right? Like, yeah, but what you've done there is you've missed the biggest opportunity of the whole thing, which is the unification. The thing that, the fact that actually, no, the hill you want to die on is that it really is the same thing. You don't want a new term for it. So that's just an example of the. Of kind. Kind of. You know, it's good advice if you want to avoid arguments. But if, if your point is that. No, it actually is. That's the whole point. We need to have a better understanding of memory. This is, this is, you know, I want those arguments. Then, then that's, that's something else. And that's the kind of, you know, that's the kind of strategic thing that you should decide on your own what you want to do.",

And it's going to be hard, right? Lots of blood, sweat and tears. It's a hard job. There's constant criticism. That's how science goes. Lots of stress. But so now the question is, are you going to have that stress following somebody else's research agenda or yours? You'll still be old and stressed out by the end of it.

Well, Michael, speaking of limited time, I appreciate you spending yours with me and with the crew here today. Today. Super. Thanks so much, so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah, it's great to see you again. Great discussion. I, I love talking to you. Thanks for having me. So many times. It's been, it's been really excellent. So Taylor Swift has a tour called the eras tour. Okay. Okay. You've been around since 2000, active in the, in the field. Okay. This is akin to the Michael Levin ERAS Tour. All of Michael's work, well, not all of it, but the milestones, the greatest, greatest hits in approximately two hours or so. So share this if you're a fan of Michael's work and well, Michael, thank you. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Firstly, thank you for watching. Thank you for listening.

Secondly, if you haven't subscribed or clicked that like button, now is the time to do so. Why? Because each subscribe each like helps YouTube push this content to more people like yourself. Plus it helps out Kurt to directly aka me. I also found out last year that external links count plenty toward the algorithm.

      "transcript_text": "Firstly, thank you for watching. Thank you for listening. There's now a website kurtjimungle.org and that has a mailing list. The reason being that large platforms like YouTube, like Patreon, they can disable disable you for whatever reason whenever they like. That's just part of the terms of service. Now a direct mailing list ensures that I have an untrammeled communication with you. Plus soon I'll be releasing a one page PDF of my top ten toes. It's not as Quentin Tarantino as it sounds like. Secondly, if you haven't subscribed or clicked that like button, now is the time to do so. Why? Because each subscribe each like helps YouTube push this content to more people like yourself. Plus it helps out Kurt to directly aka me. I also found out last year that external links count plenty toward the algorithm. Which means that whenever you share on Twitter, say on Facebook or even on Reddit, etc. It shows YouTube. Hey, people are talking about this content outside of YouTube, which in turn greatly aids the distribution on YouTube. Thirdly, there's a remarkably active discord and subreddit for theories of everything where people explicate toes. They disagree respectfully about theories and build as a community our own own toe links to both are in the description. Fourthly, you should know this podcast is on itunes, it's on Spotify, it's on all of the audio platforms. All you have to do is type in theories of everything and you'll find it. Personally, I gained from rewatching lectures and podcasts. I also read in the comments that hey toll listeners also gain from replaying. So how about instead you re listen on those platforms like itunes, Spotify, Google podcasts, whichever podcast catcher you use. And finally, if you'd like to support more conversations like this, more content like this, then do consider visiting patreon.com kurtjamungle and donating with whatever you like. There's also PayPal, there's also crypto, there's also just joining on YouTube. Again, keep in mind it's support from the sponsors and you that allow me to work on toe full time. You also get early access to ad free episodes. Whether it's audio or video. It's audio in the case of Patreon, video in the case of YouTube. For instance. This episode that you're listening to right now was released a few days earlier. Earlier. Every dollar helps far more than you think. Either way, your viewership is generosity enough. Thank you so. Much.",
